{"text": "Tara and I have been married for 15 years, and we have 3 biological children. In 2014, we took a missions trip to the country of Haiti. It was durring that time that we feel in love with Haiti and it's people. God truly broke our hearts for the need that is there, and began stirring our hearts with compassion. On the plane ride home, we knew God was calling us to something, we just weren't sure what it was yet.\nA few weeks later, we knew what God was leading us to...adopt a child from Haiti. It was not a hard decision to adopt, because we really feel like it's a calling on our lives. We spent months praying about it just to make sure our decision was not an emotional one. So after much prayer, we knew exactly what we were to do, adopt from Haiti! Not to our surprise, our 3 children are so excited about the direction our family is going. We have never seen his face, but he already has a place and a name here in our hearts.\nWe know that this is something God has called us to and we are stepping out in faith to follow His calling. International adoption is a very expensive journey, but we belive that if God has called us to it, He will see us through it. We also belive that God will use other people to see this calling come to fruition. We are using Adoption Bridge as a way to encourage other people to be apart of saving a life! Giving hope to a child who is in great need. We can do so much more together than we can alone. We ask you to please prayerfully consider partnering with us, both in prayer and financially. Thank you so much!\nIsaiah 42:1 - \"I have called you by name and you are Mine.\"\nWe are so excited for your family and this journey you are on. You have touched our lives in so many ways and this is just our small way of letting you know that we love you and appreciate you so much! We can't wait to meet your little boy!\nCongratulations! Isaiah and your family will be in our thoughts and prayers for a safe journey.\nWe wish you all the best. Many many blessings!\nVery excited for you all... especially Isaiah!\nWe are happy to help. We are praying for success.\nI love you guys and can't wait to meet sweet Isaiah! I have been praying for you and for him for a long time, and I will continue to do so. Love you all!!\nMy heart and prayers have been with you all ever since I knew of this journey. You have so much love to give and your new son has been designed by God to belong to you. So excited to get to be part of this journey!\nWe love you guys so much. We are so excited for Isaiah to arrive.\nWe are so excited for you guys. Love you and keep us posted on how things progress! Love, the Cooks!\nIt is a blessing that you are following God's leading.\nWe will be praying you reach your goal quickly.\nCan't wait to meet your boy!\nWe are so excited for you guys! Can't wait to meet Isaiah!\nMay God Bless you as you live out the adoption we have been granted in Jesus Christ.\nPraying for you all and Isaiah. We look forward to meeting your son. All our love and support!\nSo then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith. ~Galatians 6:10 Our thoughts and prayers are with you and Isaiah! What a blessing to know that when God created Isaiah, he was created to be a part of the Olsen Family. God is Amazing!\nGod bless your family (including Isaiah)!\nWe are praying for your family! Can't wait till he's home!\nCongrats to your family. We are so excited for you guys! God Bless!\nWe are so excited for your family!!!\nPraying for you guys through the process, and little Isaiah!\nThis is awesome of y'all. We have been praying for this for a while now. We can't wait to meet him. Congrats! Y'all will be perfect for him.\nSo excited for your family. Glad we could be a part of it.\nWe are so excited for you and pray that the adoption process goes smoothly.\nIt is exciting to see you guys follow God's leading and adopting Isaiah from Haiti! I will be praying for you guys throughout your journey.\nIf there is ANYTHING I can do to help your family prepare for Isaiah please let me know. We hope to give more in the future. We still have our own adoption expenses leftover.......Let me know if it would help your children to talk to Claire about what it is like to have a new sibling in the family. We will keep your family in our prayers! We are so happy for you!\nI love you all so much!

{"text": "Last month, tens of thousands of Floridians in Hurricane Irma\u2019s path were told to evacuate their homes to assure the safety of their families. When they returned after the storm, widespread power outages throughout the state presented a looming danger in the form of carbon monoxide poisoning as many residents relied on generators as their only source of electricity.\nPeople and animals in these spaces can be poisoned and even die from exposure to the poisonous gas. Everyone is at risk for carbon monoxide poisoning but infants, the elderly, and people with continuous heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to become diseased from carbon monoxide exposure.\nEach year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning not linked to fires, more than 20,000 visit the emergency room, and more than 4,000 are hospitalized. Because initial symptoms often depict the flu and can be as ordinary as fatigue, nausea, dizziness and headaches, carbon monoxide poisoning is often labeled as the silent killer.\nAs apparent in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, it is not always obvious where probable origins of carbon monoxide poisoning can be. In fact, the number of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning usually grows in the cooler months ahead as many homeowners turn on their furnaces to keep their families warm and comfortable for the season.\nService Experts Heating & Air Conditioning suggests updating your carbon monoxide detectors every five years and checking your carbon monoxide and fire detectors each month to verify the batteries and alarm are functioning properly.\nCall Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning today at 469-249-1971 or schedule an analysis of carbon monoxide and other harmful indoor air pollutant levels online.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T04:27:51Z", "url": "https://www.levyandsonnorth.com/blog/is-your-home-defended-against-the-silent-killer", "byte_size": 1783, "char_size": 1781}

{"text": "I am not a witch. I\u2019m a cute dog! I just dressed as a witch for Halloween.\nHalloween scares me a little for one big reason.\nThough I love the treats I get\u2014an extra rawhide that\u2019s vet-recommended\u2014I don\u2019t like the tricks part of it.\nMy BFF Shelley likes to dress me up for three reasons: sometimes on Halloween, always on Christmas and whenever it\u2019s cold and we\u2019re outside or on a walk. I\u2019ve been a witch, a mechanic with a pink bandana and a school girl with a tan skirt and white cable knit sweater. And at Christmas, I have to wear my green T-shirt with an image of Santa with one of his reindeer.\nBut I don\u2019t like it. When I was little, I\u2019d squirm right out of my clothes, or bunch them up, or get my little paw caught in one of the arms. Now that I\u2019m older, I just put up with it.\nI\u2019ve done some research and found that dressing up dogs in over-the-top costumes is usually for the pet owners\u2019 benefit and not for the sake of the pet. It\u2019s OK to dress us up to be warm but not if the costume physically restricts our movements or causes discomfort. Shelley puts me in a warm jacket or sweater if it\u2019s cold out, and I like it well enough after I get used to the extra layer and understand I can still walk.\nBut when large sections of our bodies are covered by material, it\u2019s hard for us to communicate with other dogs, particularly because body language is one of our major methods for expressing ourselves. Granted, I really don\u2019t like other dogs unless they\u2019re smaller than me, though I do like cats. Still, I need to get my message across.\nSome dogs become scared or confused when they are dressed up, and some won\u2019t express themselves. Things on our heads, like hats and hoods, can be particularly disturbing, because they\u2019re in the way and we\u2019re not used to them.\nAnyway, here are some photos of me in costume, but as you can see, I don\u2019t look that excited. I\u2019d rather have a treat and no tricks and silly costumes.\nI\u2019m not very happy in my witch\u2019s hat. My BFF Shelley took a photo and took if off of me, thank goodness!\nI am dressed as a mechanic. This costume isn\u2019t as bad because it doesn\u2019t have a hat!\nWhy am I wearing a silly bow that matches my silly shirt?\nI\u2019m opening my Christmas presents. I\u2019m wearing my Christmas shirt!\nI am a very talented and cute dachshund named Zoey.\nNearly every week in 2016, I \u201csat\u201d at the laptop (I\u2019m a lapdog, too!) and wrote a blog about \u2026 well, mainly about me.\nIt\u2019s because I like to \u201cshake\u201d things up as I \u201croll\u201d with the flow.\nAm I funny? I can do tricks and write my trick words into my post.\nI\u2019ve been blogging since 2011 about my life as a cute dachshund, sharing stories and photos to demonstrate the fact.\nBeing both a dog blogger and a canine poet able to write poems from a dog\u2019s perspective.\nUnderstanding dog behavior and what dogs need and want from their owners. I wrote about how pet owners\u2014I call mine my BFF\u2014need to let us know how much we mean to them, pay attention to us (like all of the time) and give us lots of treats (even healthy ones).\nRealizing the elements of responsible pet ownership, like giving us healthy food without too many unhealthy table scraps, avoiding giving us chocolate and onions, and taking us on regular walks.\nAnd, most importantly, telling really interesting stories from my own life.\nI also wrote about cats, even though most of them don\u2019t like me too much. I like cats, birds, geese and anything else in the animal kingdom, but not dogs, at least those larger than me. I bark at them, and they look at me as if I\u2019m silly, so I bark again, while also wiggling my tail. They then ignore me.\nI don\u2019t like it, so I\u2019ve concluded that cats are safer; they\u2019re not keen on dogs, and I can just pretend they are.\nIn 2017, I may take a small break from blogging as my BFF and I figure out our blogging goals for the year.

{"text": "So you want a college degree.\nIn the USA, about the only acceptable answer is \u201cChaaa, to get a bitchin\u2019 new Camaro, hombre!\u201d If you are a parent and already have a bitchin\u2019 Camaro, you want your children to go to college so they, too, can afford their own bitchin\u2019 Camaros. Education is just that important! More education, more Camaros.\nDo you think I\u2019m cynical? Do you think I consider my countrymen to be that crass and \u2014 heaven forfend \u2014 stupid?\nWell, yes I am. And yes, yes I do.\nI\u2019ve based my conclusions on a lifetime of observations of what Americans truly value. It isn\u2019t education, really. We don\u2019t care what kind of low-brow, thick-fingered troglodyte dullard you resemble as long as you have good credit and faithfully participate in consumerism. A college education has traditionally been the best path to full citizenship, where you extract the maximum compensation from a corporation in order to pay for dumb stuff that\u2019s supposed to make you happy and obviously better than others.\nSo really, I support free college for everyone. I\u2019d like college degrees to be so common that they no longer represent any potential income advantage at all. I\u2019d like to see the market flooded with not only liberal-arts majors, but also engineers, doctors, scientists \u2014 everything. At that point, we\u2019ll all be living with mom until we\u2019re 40 while working at Starbucks, and this whole spurious correlation of degree with income will be a distant memory. We\u2019ll get to study whatever we want, and to get back to actually valuing education over GM\u2019s answer to the Ford Mustang.\nYou with me on this? I hope so.\nAnyway, when politicians on stage talk about making college more available or even free, some people in their audiences get excited. The people who get excited are people who haven\u2019t yet gone to college, or parents of people who haven\u2019t yet gone. Then, there are those who get resentful. These are the people still making college loan payments.\nIn the minds of the people who get excited there floats one specific image. It\u2019s not an image of long nights spent inhaling the wisdom buried in books, nor hunched over a laptop writing the one research paper to end all research papers. It\u2019s not an image of long conversations on campus with other seekers, when all come to some new mutual understanding of a truth revealed. It\u2019s not an image of a lifetime spent as an enlightened citizen armed with the knowledge and cognitive tools to make good choices in one\u2019s community and to truly participate in democracy.\nNo. The image is of a yellow Camaro. With stripes. Just like Bumblebee from Transformers.\nSo perhaps it\u2019s only just that college not be free after all. It\u2019s not really about education, see. It\u2019s more like a business. Put in your 4-6 years and your $100K-$250K and if you\u2019ve played your cards right, you have income for life. But the only way this can work is if there is some entrance fee. Gotta keep it exclusive in some way.

{"text": "Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo crashed on Friday 31 October during a test flight in California\u2019s Mojave Desert, killing one of the two crewmembers.\nIt is early and premature to make any hypothesis about what went wrong with SpaceShipTwo, but this accident is a wake up call to the industry about how dangerous it is to run a business involving the safety of so many people \u2013 crews, paying customers, spaceport personnel, and even the public at large \u2013 in a regime of silence and lack of transparency.\nThe accident itself, the first fatality of the newly established space tourism industry, is likely to set back Virgin\u2019s plan to carry paying customers to space for quite a while. An inappropriate response to the crisis from Virgin Galactic, however, is more likely to kill the industry once and for all.\nAt the time of the accident, there are hundreds of people who paid a deposit towards the $250,000 required for a flight that promises a 5-minutes space experience. Virgin\u2019s approach towards the crisis resulting from the accident will determine how many of them will stick to their original plan.\nVirgin Galactic\u2019s original plan to begin operations by the end of the first decade of the millennium has been postponed several times, without ever disclosing the reasons behind such delays.\nIn reality, in aviation a tail stall is a very dangerous event that reveals a shortcoming of the vehicle. Senior space journalist Leonard David, who investigated the matter a little bit further, collected the comments of an observer who said bluntly that the craft \u201cdropped like a rock and went straight down.\u201d The witness, however, remained anonymous, and Leonard\u2019s article was one of the few ones about the accidents that made it to the press. The only thing that is know for sure is that it took Scaled Composites more than a year to address the issue and return the vehicle to test flight, and that by 2014 they were not significantly closer to start operations.\nA testing plan, even an aggressive one, is always designed with the intent to preserve the lives of the people involved. We believe that Virgin Galactic and Scaled Composites never had the intent put the lives of their crew in danger. But \u201cSpace is hard\u201d is a very poor statement to release in face of the death of a man. The family of the victims, as well as Virgin Galactic\u2019s paying customers, deserve to know more about a \u201cserious anomaly\u201d that killed \u201cone of the two Scaled Composites pilots.\u201d And no, \u201cspace is hard\u201d is not an excuse.\nIn the video below, Stuart Witt, CEO of Mojave Air and Space Port, releases a statement about the accident in a press release.\nJust a few days ago, an Antares rocket exploded five seconds after liftoff. The event, which was televised live on NASA TV, left the commenter speechless. A few hours after the incident, Orbital formed a permanent Accident Investigation Board, under the supervision of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), that included company officials along with representatives from NASA and the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB).\nOrbital Sciences, a company with a history and reputation in the space business, handled the crisis very transparently and professionally. Not one of their statements read like \u201cspace is hard, and rockets explode,\u201d and there is a good reason for this. The launch of Orbital\u2019s Cygnus cargo vehicle is ultimately financed on taxpayer money, and a serious investigation, with independent supervision from well-established external authorities, is a necessary step for them to regain their credibility.\nWe hope Virgin Galactic will take similar steps to disclose the full extent of the problem, and reveal enough of the measures taken to prevent fatal accidents from happening again. Space activities are inherently risky, as launch failures, space disasters, and close calls have shown in over 60 years of spaceflight history. We are sure that people who desire to go to space are willing to take some risk. But they have the right to be informed about the nature of the risk, and must be reassured with facts, and not with words, that everything is being done to make sure they will come back alive.\nAn embarrassing mistake: thanks for pointing it out!", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T09:48:33Z", "url": "http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/space-disasters/virgin-galactic/spaceshipone-disaster-matter-transparency/", "byte_size": 4249, "char_size": 4205}

{"text": "1. How did your baking/caking journey begin?\nIf I showed you all the birthday cakes I made for my Triplet's 8th Birthday almost 10 years ago, you may have politely told me to \u201ckeep my day job\u201d. There was a supermarket chocolate mud cake; one of those in the clear plastic tubs. Handwritten names of my three cherubs on top using store bought coloured icing. Not to forget 3 plastic toys to complete the look. There was no indication at that stage of my life, that I could (or even should) start a Cake Business.\nIt was my last child's first birthday in 2015 that started it all, as is so often the case. We hear about it all the time; a Mum has a crazy desire to make their own child's birthday cake. They think to themselves, \u201cOh how hard can it be? Why not do it? I'll give it a go.\u201d It works, it's amazing! Not only does it look good, it tastes divine. All the other Mum's at the party wholeheartedly agree and tell her that she should start a cake business...and she does. And I did. Armed with a small cake tool box that my husband bought me as a gift, I created a Number 1 shaped cake complete with fondant and a cute looking 2D smiley giraffe face. It wasn't a great piece of art by any stretch of anybody\u2019s imagination. All I can say is that something clicked in me, something shifted and a true passion was born. A creative outlet that had been simmering in the background for over 25 years.\nStarting Sweet Lucy has meant everything to me. Not only have I been able to stay at home for my children; a goal since my triplets were born in 2000, but I have proven to myself that I can operate a business. Self doubt regarding whether I could ever be successful had held me back from opportunities for years. Looking back, I now realise that discovering my true passion had to come first to achieve lasting success and a business that I love.\nI have never been a natural artist when it comes to drawing and painting and have found that edible images are the perfect medium to create images, calligraphy and artwork that add a real professional touch.\nMy work has started to involve printed icing sheet wraps more and more. Most of these buttercream or fondant cakes to date feature a patterned wrap a quarter or a half up the side of the cake. Over the next few weeks I have orders that will have the entire side of the cake wrapped in either a flower pattern or watercolour effect. For me, the available designs are limitless and fill the gap that exists in my skillset!\nDefinitely the cake wraps mentioned above as well as the continued trend of edible image toppers for cupcakes both for children\u2019s birthday and corporate logos.\n6. What is the funniest/most unusual cake you\u2019ve been asked to create?\nA chook! One of my lovely customers asked for a full size chicken cake for her 13 year old daughter as these are her favourite animals. I was told that she didn\u2019t want to cut it!\nAlways follow Edible Image Supplies recommended schedule of daily, weekly, fortnightly and 6 monthly maintenance. If you have trouble remembering like I did, add these reminders into your phone calendar and they will automatically pop up.\nIn May this year, Sweet Lucy was awarded a Business Excellence Award in the Micro/Home Based Business Section by Bundaberg Regional Chambers of Commerce. We are also featured in 100 Faces of Small Business, a Queensland Government Initiative.\nIn regard to cake, we were fortunate to be asked to design a cupcake bouquet for a bride in July. It has been one of my favourite creations.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T01:24:17Z", "url": "https://www.edibleimagesupplies.com.au/Cake%20Blog/edible-image-supplies-edible-image-cake-blog-cake-decorating-business-startup-home-business-cake-wrap-cake-toppers-cupcake-bouquet-sweet-lucy", "byte_size": 3525, "char_size": 3509}

{"text": "One place where the gettext functions, if used normally, have big problems is within programs with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The problem is that many of the strings which have to be translated are very short. They have to appear in pull-down menus which restricts the length. But strings which are not containing entire sentences or at least large fragments of a sentence may appear in more than one situation in the program but might have different translations. This is especially true for the one-word strings which are frequently used in GUI programs.\nAs a consequence many people say that the gettext approach is wrong and instead catgets should be used which indeed does not have this problem. But there is a very simple and powerful method to handle these kind of problems with the gettext functions.\nTo have the strings File, Printer, Open, New, Select, and Connect translated there has to be at some point in the code a call to a function of the gettext family. But in two places the string passed into the function would be Open. The translations might not be the same and therefore we are in the dilemma described above.\nOne solution to this problem is to artificially enlengthen the strings to make them unambiguous. But what would the program do if no translation is available? The enlengthened string is not what should be printed. So we should use a little bit modified version of the functions.\nWhat this little function does is to recognize the case when no translation is available. This can be done very efficiently by a pointer comparison since the return value is the input value. If there is no translation we know that the input string is in the format we used for the Menu entries and therefore contains a | character. We simply search for the last occurrence of this character and return a pointer to the character following it. That's it!\nIf one now consistently uses the enlengthened string form and replaces the gettext calls with calls to sgettext (this is normally limited to very few places in the GUI implementation) then it is possible to produce a program which can be internationalized.\nThe other gettext functions (dgettext, dcgettext and the ngettext equivalents) can and should have corresponding functions as well which look almost identical, except for the parameters and the call to the underlying function.\nNow there is of course the question why such functions do not exist in the GNU gettext package? There are two parts of the answer to this question.\nThere is no way the gettext package can contain a version which can work everywhere. The problem is the selection of the character to separate the prefix from the actual string in the enlenghtened string. The examples above used | which is a quite good choice because it resembles a notation frequently used in this context and it also is a character not often used in message strings.\nBut what if the character is used in message strings? Or if the chose character is not available in the character set on the machine one compiles (e.g., | is not required to exist for ISO C; this is why the `iso646.h' file exists in ISO C programming environments).\nThere is only one more comment to be said. The wrapper function above requires that the translations strings are not enlengthened themselves. This is only logical. There is no need to disambiguate the strings (since they are never used as keys for a search) and one also saves quite some memory and disk space by doing this.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T07:19:03Z", "url": "http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/gettext/gettext_151.html", "byte_size": 3481, "char_size": 3481}

{"text": "GSES recently gave a presentation at the APVI workshop in Brisbane as part of the International Battery Association conference. The presentation considered the drivers of battery storage, possible future business models, and the impacts on generators.\nThis article was collectively authored by Jono Pye (who gave the presentation at APVI) and others in the GSES team.\nThere is no such thing as a \u2018natural market\u2019 when it comes to electricity \u2013 there is nothing natural about buying and selling electrons.\nAll electricity markets are designed around the technology available at the time, which up until now has been large centralised generators that are located close to their fossil fuel resource. The business models of generators, transmission/distribution companies and retailers are similarly based on the available technology (and existing market).\nDistributed PV has already had a serious impact on presumed business models. It is constantly flagged that soon the price of batteries will fall to the point where distributed storage is common place. Such a dramatic shift in the technology of the electricity market promises to disrupt many of the incumbent players . Much has been written about the utility \u2018death spiral\u2019, in which utilities, facing a reduction in the use of their networks, will increase the unit cost of energy to make up their revenue, which in turn will increase the incentive for customers to use less energy.\n2) that there is either no need for a back-up power source or that a grid connection is more expensive than a generator.\nIn suburban areas with houses powered by distributed PV with battery storage, there will still be the need for a grid and a utility to manage it. The question then becomes: how will distributed storage integrate into the current market?\nTo a large extent this will depend on which stakeholders in the industry retain ownership of the batteries; whether this ownership rests with private individuals, utilities or a new type of gentailer.\nPrivately owned systems present the greatest threat to utilities and retailers, as customers with these systems are theoretically able to provide all their own energy needs.\nAlthough there will be a market for these systems, they will have a high upfront cost and leave the owner responsible for their maintenance and to pay for equipment failures in the system.\nThe group of customers that go down this path of self-ownership will be the early adopters; those that have been waiting eagerly for the price of batteries to drop to a point they can exploit their PV systems to their full potential, and be completely self-reliant.\nDistributed storage will allow customers to leave the grid entirely.\nThe role of a utility is to provide the infrastructure required for consumers to have access to electricity \u2013 batteries could be viewed as a simple extension of this infrastructure.\nUtilities could provide batteries at street level that were owned and operated by the utility, dispatching during peak times to reduce the demand and strain on their network.\nHow this would function with the wholesale electricity market (and the market rules) would be challenging, with the utilities themselves buying electricity during low periods to charge batteries, and using it to suppress demand during peaks.\nUtilities could operate batteries either at a street or residential level.\nUtilities could also provide batteries in the home. In this situation, the utility would retain ownership of the battery and lease its use to the customer. Customers could then choose how they utilise the system; either storing energy from their PV array, or from the grid during low demand.\nWhatever the ownership model, in this new market there will still be a need for a back-up power source: to provide power for PV customers during periods of low irradiance, and to charge the batteries of those customers who do not have PV.\nThe purpose of an energy retailer is to buy energy from the wholesale market on a customer\u2019s behalf and deliver it to their door, paying the network providers for their services along the way.\nIn order to ensure they can supply the required energy throughout the day, retailers either hold Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), or physically hedge themselves with their own fleet of generators. Coal traditionally supplies the baseline, with open and combined cycle gas turbines supplying the peaks.\nIn many ways, distributed storage can be thought of in the same way as a peaking generator. When a retailer acquires a new customer, instead of ensuring they have enough generation or futures contracts to cover the new demand, they will also have the option to install a storage system (either with or without PV).\nRetailers will be able to provide customers with the energy they need through a mixture of battery storage, PV, and the wholesale market. This mixture can be optimised to suit either their generation assets or existing power purchase agreements.\nThe benefit to customers in this situation is that all risk and responsibility are carried by the retailer. Very little changes in the way the consumer must think of their energy consumption: being able to pay either a fixed monthly lease payment, or a tariff rate for their energy.\nThis model also provides Gentailers with an incentive to maintain the system and process equipment at its end of life, hopefully leading to responsible recycling and reclamation of these products.\nThis article was collectively authored by Jono Pye, and others in the team at GSES (Global Sustainable Energy Solutions).\nGSES is a renewable energy engineering, training and consultancy company specialising in photovoltaic solar design, online and face-to-face solar training, publishing solar books and PV system audits.\nFurther background to Jono can be found on Jono\u2019s LinkedIn profile.\nFast Frequency Service \u2013 Treating the symptom not the cause?\nThe National Electricity Market (NEM) is designed to operate at 50 Hz. Frequency deviation occurs when generation and load are mismatched. It is important in a lightly meshed and long network such as the NEM to maintain tight frequency control and that frequency response is available throughout the network.\nAfter spending a day looking into the future (at prospective generation developments) I noted this reverse correlation between wind and volatility that\u2019s been occurring over the week.\n7 Comments on \"Three Possible Business Models for Distributed Storage\"\nI think you are missing the other option that will be relevant in many locations. Community ownership can be considered a mix of private and utility ownership where the term \u201cdistributed\u201d really comes into its own \u2013 and local smart-grids can implement the integration of all relevant options in the most economical way.\nLocal smart-grids (community or utility owned) will need to operate like the internet, where various levels of operation will occur to meet current conditions. As far as end-users are concerned, their power supplies should be seamlessly selected from the available supplies \u2013 via the transmission system or from local sources depending on availability, security and cost considerations.\nThere could be others evolve, as well \u2013 in the NEM there are a couple of Demand Response Aggregators operating in a variety of forms. It may be them that take the step of owning and dispatching the resources.\nI think you raise a good point, local mini grids have many advantages and I think there is definite potential for these, particularly in rural areas. The business model will be much more of a complete energy provider, supplying both generation and distribution (gentility?). There is the potential for a large cost saving with this model, and I think it will become more common as the price of storage drops below distribution infrastructure costs.\njust had to say that a co-op and that is what you are getting at will not work (sorry) no co-op works that good.\nStand alone is the only way to go. Generate your own power,store it in battery\u2019s and use it when you need it.\nNow generating power and have it on hand is the hard part so it seems I must admit that it could not be done however I have seen a genorator that works off a 12 volt system and genorates it\u2019s own power running an inverter that runs this persons home. He made it in his shed.\nIt was something I had never seen before and I have been round for 1/2 a century. It really did work how I do not know! Will he make another one not sure! Will he sell it I can give the answer to that NO I tried to buy it but no way and I had to make sure I did not tell anyone his name or where he lives.\nNo co-op works that well?\nI would have thought coops for electrons would suffer seriously with small scale operation due to the problem of peak demand and all electrons not being of the same value at varying times. The coop would clearly need to engage itself with demand management- ie smart meters and peak pricing and the investment and admin of that on a small scale may well prove the greatest hurdle, absent the economies of scale of Big Gen now.\nAs well we live in a mobile world and attaching a lien to my home via a street, block or whole suburb power coop would be one I\u2019d have to carefully consider buying into. After all if I sell up and move, there\u2019s no guarantee the next buyer wants to be shackled with my home\u2019s power coop obligation. That would leave most to consider stand alone system economics only and their risk return should there be a change of plans and any forced move in future. Again Big Gen has the edge over any small scale coop there.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T09:23:57Z", "url": "http://www.wattclarity.com.au/articles/2014/03/three-possible-business-models-for-distributed-storage/", "byte_size": 9627, "char_size": 9587}

{"text": "India should make a long term investment in ensuring that a Taliban-type of government never comes to power again in Afghanistan.\nTHROUGHOUT THE 1980s and the 1990s, India looked at the developments in Afghanistan with a certain amount of dismay. It could not fathom the former Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. Initially, the policy makers in New Delhi initially tried to find a political way out \u2014 gently persuading the Soviet Union to withdraw. India even offered to work with Pakistan to find a political solution. But Pakistan's Zia-ul-Haq refused to oblige. The Cold War politics practiced by the Great Powers in Afghanistan was too complex for India to intervene effectively.\nAfter the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, India kept a close watch on Islamabad's game plan. New Delhi's moves such as helping Burhanuddin Rabbani met with extremely limited success. Alarm bells began ringing with the Taliban's arrival on the scene in 1994. India saw a link between the developments in Jammu and Kashmir, the Taliban's creation and the way it was consolidating its position in Afghanistan. India's efforts to sensitise the great powers about this development had no success. After the capture of Kabul in September 1996, India closed down its mission there.\nHowever, as a goodwill gesture to the Afghan people and its long-standing relationship with Kabul, India maintained contacts with the Taliban and the Northern Alliance forces and continued humanitarian assistance to both factions.\nThe hijacking of the Indian Airlines flight IC-814 to Kandahar on Christmas-eve in 1999 brought a swift change in India's policy towards the Taliban. By the spring of 2000, Pakistan's game plan of trying to divide Afghanistan on ethnic lines was known in the rest of the neighbourhood \u2014 Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and India were quick to evolve a commonality of interests. India set itself two tasks: not to allow Afghanistan's territorial integrity to be disturbed under any circumstances; and to strengthen the Northern Alliance to fight the Taliban. India then decided to make its presence felt to beef up the forces of the Northern Alliance. Strategically, making the Turkmenistan capital, Dushanbe, a staging post made a lot of sense as it is close to the Northern Alliance stronghold, Panjshir Valley. A field hospital at Farkhar, near Dushanbe, was established in early 2000.\nSimultaneously, the airfields in and around Dushanbe were made operational to ferry equipment to the Northern Alliance. India also began coordinating efforts with the Central Asian Republics. They agreed to be part of the broad front being proposed by India along with Iran. They readily opened their stores of Soviet vintage arms and ammunition and aircraft to the Northern Alliance.\nThis was also the period during which Ahmed Shah Masood made unannounced visits to India, the last being in May 2001, to refine his strategy in combating the Taliban. In his assessment, the Taliban could not last a single day without Pakistan's military support; and India having fought four wars with Pakistan understood the latter's military machine better than anyone.\nThough not conclusively proven, circumstantial evidence shows that the Taliban-Al-Qaeda leadership assumed that eliminating Masood would automatically result in a collapse of the Northern Alliance. In spite of warnings from friendly countries such India, Masood decided to give an interview to an \"Algerian\" television network during which he was killed. That was on September 9, 2001.\nThe Taliban-Al-Qaeda underestimated Masood's vision and foresight. Anticipating an eventuality of this type, he groomed three of his close associates \u2014 Mohammad Fahim, Abdullah Abdullah and Qanooni. The assassination of Masood did dampen spirits to a certain extent. The September 11, 2001, attacks by the Taliban-Al-Qaeda on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon woke the U.S. from its slumber. The triumvirate \u2014 Mr. Qanooni, Mr. Abdullah and Gen. Fahim \u2014 proved brilliant in preparing their forces to synchronise their attacks with that of the U.S. They were also aware that the U.S. was unlikely to seek their help.\nAs late as 2001, one U.S. diplomat in Islamabad dismissed Masood as irrelevant, adding that Washington saw him as part of the problem and not as part of the solution.\"\nAs the U.S. war, Operation Enduring Freedom, started on October 7, 2001, though India extended complete support to it, things did not move the way it expected. One of Afghanistan's neighbours, Iran, was more or less excluded from the alliance; and India's intelligence inputs were seen by the U.S. war-planners through the spectrum of India-Pakistan relations.\nThe Northern Alliance was seen as an appendage of India. The first three weeks of bombing, from October 7 to 28, 2001, produced no tangible results to the U.S. on the ground. The widespread criticism of aimless U.S. bombing and high civilian casualties brought the whole operation under severe criticism. At this point, Indian and Russian intervention made the U.S. war planners see the logic of cooperating with Northern Alliance. In the crucial meeting on October 30, 2001, between the U.S. theatre commander, Gen. Tommy Franks, and the Northern Alliance, an agreement was reached on cooperation between the two. In the subsequent nine days, the Northern Alliance was able to capture Mazar-e-Sharif, and reach the outskirts of Kabul. During this Northern Alliance campaign, nine battalions of the Pakistani armed forces were either decimated or made to flee southwards to safer places. One version of the events was that Pakistani GHQ in Rawalpindi issued orders to its men to rush back to safer places. If this is true, the exodus of so-called Taliban soldiers from Mazar-e-Sharif, Kabul and other areas in early November 2001, as Northern Alliance troops marched in can be attributed to it.\nBy this time everyone associated with the Northern Alliance including the U.S. itself realised what good fighters the Northern Alliance men were and started admiring Masood's vision in training such a formidable force. On November 13, against the protests from Pakistan, Northern Alliance troops entered Kabul. India on the success of its subtle diplomacy immediately announced the reopening of the Embassy in Kabul.\nOn the Government that should come in Kabul after the fall of the Taliban, India and the Afghan neighbourhood (with the exception of Pakistan) had well defined objectives from the beginning \u2014 it should not have any Taliban or any of its allies/friends/sympathisers anywhere near the corridors of power.\nThough some of the extra regional powers and Pakistan try to make the Taliban movement synonymous with the Pashtuns, India always refused to buy this theory. In fact, the Indian debate during that period was that there were lots of groups among the Pashtuns who opposed the Taliban from the beginning. Instead of looking at Afghanistan through the spectrum of ethnicity, all the forces that opposed the Taliban-type of rule should be in the new Government; it should be as broad-based as possible.\nThis concern remains even now. India should make a long term investment in ensuring that a Taliban-type of government never comes to power again in Afghanistan. In whichever sector the present Afghan Government seeks help, India should respond positively.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T17:46:32Z", "url": "http://www.mea.gov.in/articles-in-indian-media.htm?dtl/14368/Indias+Afghan+policy", "byte_size": 7383, "char_size": 7371}

{"text": "Ford is building cars that \"talk\" with traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians.\nAt CES 2019 in Las Vegas on Monday, the automaker announced plans to start selling cars that feature this type of technology in 2022.\nThe technology, called cellular vehicle-to-everything (or C-V2X for short), uses wireless signals to share road data, such as a car's location or the color of a traffic light, with other vehicles.\nFord believes it will make cities safer by better informing drivers of their surroundings, and compares the innovation to the invention of the traffic light in the 19th century.\n\"The world's first traffic light [helped] people move through a congested London intersection that had become dangerous for pedestrians due to the popularity of horse-drawn carriages,\" Don Butler, executive director of Ford Connected Vehicle Platform and Product, wrote in a Medium post. \"At Ford, 150 years later, we are excited to continue advancing this type of thinking.\"\nBut critics says the cost of installing the technology will be burdensome for cash-strapped governments. Corinne Kisner, deputy director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, called the expense of installing and maintaining vehicle-to-everything technology a major concern. Many municipalities struggle to fill their potholes, let alone install smart city technology. She also described any effort to require a pedestrian to carry a smartphone to guarantee safety as a dangerous paradigm shift.\n\"It's an unreasonable burden to ask or require people walking in their streets and cities and in front of their homes to carry a signal transmitting device,\" Kisner said. \"The burden needs to be on the driver of the two-ton vehicle, whether it's a human or autonomous technology.\"\nFord sees things differently. Butler described to CNN Business the example of a pedestrian walking on a dirt road who might be identified by a car with C-V2X because they were carrying a smartphone. Traditionally, a driver would rely on their headlights to see the pedestrian. But Butler stops short of expecting smartphones to be recommended or required for pedestrians.\n\"It's like the question of will people be permitted to drive once autonomous vehicles become prevalent,\" Butler said. \"That's something we can only speculate about.\"\nFord isn't the first company to explore outfitting pedestrians with sensors. Siemens, the German conglomerate, began a US Department of Transportation pilot test in Tampa, Florida, last year using pedestrians' smartphones to communicate their location to vehicles. But Siemens officials found the smartphone location data to be so inaccurate that it wasn't useful.\nThe pilot was reworked to focus on outfitting 1,000 vehicles with sensors, and notifying drivers of nearby vehicles with audio alerts, according to Dave Miller, the head of connected vehicles at Siemens.\nBicycling advocates also argued it was unrealistic to require someone to carry a phone on roads.\n\"We think the way things are headed, what we need is more smart sensors [built] in the roadway, or infrastructure,\" Miller told CNN Business.\nThis is something Ford wants, too. It sees the coming arrival of 5G networks -- the next-generation of internet speed -- as a chance to install vehicle-to-everything technology throughout cities.\n\"We think there's an opportunity for a win-win that helps offset to a significant degree the cost a city might have to otherwise undertake to deploy this infrastructure,\" Butler said.\nFord is urging other automakers to install C-V2X in their vehicles.\nBut there's a long road ahead for Ford to make C-V2X as widespread as the traffic light, which took decades to be popularized.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T12:57:18Z", "url": "https://www.wlfi.com/content/national/504015922.html", "byte_size": 3688, "char_size": 3688}

{"text": "We all have read the tales told of Jesus in the Gospels, but few people really have a good idea of their context. Yet it is quite enlightening to examine them against the background of the time and place in which they were written, and my goal here is to help you do just that. There is abundant evidence that these were times replete with kooks and quacks of all varieties, from sincere lunatics to ingenious frauds, even innocent men mistaken for divine, and there was no end to the fools and loons who would follow and praise them. Placed in this context, the gospels no longer seem to be so remarkable, and this leads us to an important fact: when the Gospels were written, skeptics and informed or critical minds were a small minority. Although the gullible, the credulous, and those ready to believe or exaggerate stories of the supernatural are still abundant today, they were much more common in antiquity, and taken far more seriously.\nIf the people of that time were so gullible or credulous or superstitious, then we have to be very cautious when assessing the reliability of witnesses of Jesus. As Thomas Jefferson believed when he composed his own version of the gospels, Jesus may have been an entirely different person than the Gospels tell us, since the supernatural and other facts about him, even some of his parables or moral sayings, could easily have been added or exaggerated by unreliable witnesses or storytellers. Thus, this essay is not about whether Jesus was real or how much of what we are told about him is true. It is not even about Jesus. Rather, this essay is a warning and a standard, by which we can assess how likely or easily what we are told about Jesus may be false or exaggerated, and how little we can trust anyone who claims to be a witness of what he said and did. For if all of these other stories below could be told and believed, even by Christians themselves, it follows that the Gospels, being of entirely the same kind, can all too easily be inaccurate, tainted by the gullibility, credulity, or fondness for the spectacular which characterized most people of the time.\nEven in Acts, we get an idea of just how gullible people could be. Surviving a snake bite was evidently enough for the inhabitants of Malta to believe that Paul himself was a god (28:6). And Paul and his comrade Barnabas had to go to some lengths to convince the Lycaonians of Lystra that they were not deities. For the locals immediately sought to sacrifice to them as manifestations of Hermes and Zeus, simply because a man with bad feet stood up (14:8-18). These stories show how ready people were to believe that gods can take on human form and walk among them, and that a simple show was sufficient to convince them that mere men were such divine beings. And this evidence is in the bible itself.\nBeyond the bible, the historian Josephus supplies some insights. Writing toward the end of the first century, himself an eye-witness of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D, he tells us that the region was filled with \"cheats and deceivers claiming divine inspiration\" (Jewish War, 2.259-60; Jewish Antiquities, 20.167), entrancing the masses and leading them like sheep, usually to their doom. The most successful of these \"tricksters\" appears to be \"the Egyptian\" who led a flock of 30,000 believers around Palestine (Jewish War, 2.261-2; Paul is mistaken for him by a Roman officer in Acts 21:38). This fellow even claimed he could topple the walls of Jerusalem with a single word (Jewish Antiquities, 20.170), yet it took a massacre at the hands of Roman troops to finally instill doubt in his followers.\nTwenty years later, a common weaver named Jonathan would attract a mob of the poor and needy, promising to show them many signs and portents (Jewish War, 7.437-8). Again, it took military intervention to disband the movement. Josephus also names a certain Theudas, another \"trickster\" who gathered an impressive following in Cyrene around 46 A.D., claiming he was a prophet and could part the river Jordan (Jewish Antiquities, 20.97). This could be the same Theudas mentioned in Acts 5:36. Stories like these also remind us of the faithful following that Simon was reported to have had in Acts 8:9-11, again showing how easy it was to make people believe you had \"the power of god\" at your disposal. Jesus was not unique in that respect.\nMiracles were also a dime a dozen in this era. The biographer Plutarch, a contemporary of Josephus, engages in a lengthy digression to prove that a statue of Tyche did not really speak in the early Republic (Life of Coriolanus 37.3). He claims it must have been a hallucination inspired by the deep religious faith of the onlookers, since there were, he says, too many reliable witnesses to dismiss the story as an invention (38.1-3). He even digresses further to explain why other miracles such as weeping or bleeding--even moaning--statues could be explained as natural phenomena, showing a modest but refreshing degree of skeptical reasoning that would make the Amazing Randi proud. What is notable is not that Plutarch proves himself to have some good sense, but that he felt it was necessary to make such an argument at all. Clearly, such miracles were still reported and believed in his own time. I find this to be a particularly interesting passage, since we have thousands of believers flocking to weeping and bleeding statues even today. Certainly the pagan gods must also exist if they could make their statues weep and bleed as well!\nMiraculous healings were also commonplace. Suetonius, another biographer writing a generation after Plutarch, reports that even the emperor Vespasian once cured the blind and lame (Life of Vespasian 7.13; this \"power\" being attributed to the god Serapis--incidentally the Egyptian counterpart to Asclepius; cf. also Tacitus, Histories 4.81). Likewise, statues with healing powers were common attractions for sick people of this era. Lucian mentions the famous healing powers of a statue of Polydamas, an athlete, at Olympia, as well as the statue of Theagenes at Thasos (Council of the Gods 12). Both are again mentioned by Pausanias, in his \"tour guide\" of the Roman world (6.5.4-9, 11.2-9). Lucian also mentions the curative powers of the statue of a certain General Pellichos (Philopseudes 18-20). And Athenagoras, in his Legatio pro Christianis (26), polemicizes against the commonplace belief in the healing powers of statues, mentioning, in addition to the statue of a certain Neryllinus, the statues of Proteus and Alexander, the same two men I discuss in detail below.\nBut above all these, the \"pagans\" had Asclepius, their own healing savior, centuries before, and after, the ministry of Christ. Surviving testimonies to his influence and healing power throughout the classical age are common enough to fill a two-volume book (Edelstein and Edelstein, Asclepius: A Collection and Interpretation of the Testimonies, in two volumes, 1945--entries 423-450 contain the most vivid testimonials). Of greatest interest are the inscriptions set up for those healed at his temples. These give us almost first hand testimony, more reliable evidence than anything we have for the miracles of Jesus, of the blind, the lame, the mute, even the victims of kidney stones, paralytics, and one fellow with a spearhead stuck in his jaw (see the work cited above, p. 232), all being cured by this pagan \"savior.\" And this testimony goes on for centuries. Inscriptions span from the 4th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. and later, all over the Roman Empire. Clearly, the people of this time were quite ready to believe such tales. They were not remarkable tales at all.\nThis more general evidence of credulity in the Roman Empire shows the prevalence of belief in divine miracle working of all kinds. I will now present you with three historical individuals who truly flesh out the picture.\nApollonius, Peregrinus, and Alexander are three rather interesting religious founders about whom we know even more than we do of Jesus. The first, Apollonius of Tyana, is often called the \"pagan Christ,\" since he also lived during the first century, and performed a similar ministry of miracle-working, preaching his own brand of ascetic Pythagoreanism--he was also viewed as the son of a god, resurrected the dead, ascended to heaven, performed various miracles, and criticized the authorities with pithy wisdom much like Jesus did.\nNaturally, his story is one that no doubt grew into more and more fantastic legends over time, until he becomes an even more impressive miracle-worker than Jesus in the largest surviving work on him, The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, written by Philostratus around 220 A.D. This work is available today in two volumes as part of the Loeb Classical Library, published by Harvard University Press, a set that also includes the surviving fragments of Apollonius' own writings (if only Jesus had bothered to write something!) as well as the Treatise against him by the Christian historian Eusebius. There were other books written about him immediately after his death, but none survive.\nEven Eusebius, in his Treatise against Apollonius, does not question his existence, or the reality of many of his miracles--rather, he usually tries to attribute them to trickery or demons. This shows the credulity of the times, even among educated defenders of the Christian faith, but it also shows how easy it was to deceive. Since they readily believed in demons and magical powers, it should not surprise us that they believed in resurrections and transmutations of water to wine.\nWe also know that the cult that grew up around Apollonius survived for many centuries after his death. An inscription from as late as the 3rd century names him as a sort of pagan \"absolver of sins,\" sent from heaven (Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed., 1996). The emperor Caracalla erected a shrine to him in Tyana around 215 A.D (Dio Cassius, 78.18; for a miraculous display of clairvoyance on the part of Apollonius, see 67.18). According to one account, the ghost of Apollonius even appeared to the emperor Aurelian to convince him to stop his siege of Tyana, whereupon he also erected a shrine to him around 274 A.D. (Historia Augusta: Vita Aureliani 24.2-6).\nLater Arabic sources even discuss the fame and potency of certain relics associated with him, which remained in use well into the sixth and seventh centuries, the last of them apparently destroyed by crusaders in 1204 A.D. So popular was the belief in the power of these \"talismans\" that the Church was forced to accept their use, even while condemning Apollonius and his shrines as demonic (see sources below). And so, we see here an independent confirmation that blind belief in the divine status and miraculous powers of mere mortals easily captivated the people of this time, a fact that even modern Christians must admit.\nAn even more colorful story is that of a crazy fellow called Peregrinus, nicknamed \"Proteus,\" who set himself on fire during the Olympic games in 165 A.D. to prove his faith in reincarnation. The notion of suicide as a proof of such faith was not new. Indian Brahmans had immolated themselves before Western audiences on several occasions before, the most famous being Calanus, at Susa, in front of Alexander the Great, and Zarmarus, at Athens, in front of Augustus (Plutarch, Alexander 69.8). What is most relevant, however, is the fascinating story told about him by the skeptic Lucian in his satirical work, \"The Death of Peregrinus.\" Lucian knew Proteus personally, and he gives us a look at what the story of Jesus might have been had a skeptic been around to give us a different account.\nWhile Aulus Gellius had also met this man in Athens, and was impressed enough to call him a man of \"dignity and fortitude\" (Attic Nights 11.1-7), Lucian had another point of view. He describes the vainglorious motivations of Proteus, and the duped mobs clamoring for a miracle. He also mentions the gullibility of Christians, who, he says, were easily duped by scam artists (13). Indeed, after the death of Peregrinus, people reported that he was, like Jesus, risen from the dead, wearing white raiment, and that he ascended to heaven in the form of a vulture (40). The punch line is that this latter story may have been a deliberate invention of Lucian himself (39), told to gullible followers, and later recounted to him as if it were fact, showing the effects of the rumor mill at work. Indeed, even people who were in the same city at the time were ready to believe that an earthquake accompanied his death, reminding us of the absurd miracles surrounding the death of Jesus recounted without a blush in Matthew 27:51-54. How easy it was for such stories to be believed! Even if this tale is filled with rhetoric on the part of Lucian, his criticism of gullibility would have no weight if it did not ring true.\nPeregrinus also had a small cult following after his death. His staff was treated as a religious relic (Lucian, The Ignorant Book Collector 14), his disciples preached his doctrine (Lucian, Runaways), and his statue healed the sick and gave oracles (Athenagoras, cited above). But his bid for religious glory was not as successful as another man, Alexander of Abonuteichos. Lucian dedicates an even longer and more vicious account of his personal contacts with this man, whom he calls \"the quack prophet.\" The account alone is detailed and entertaining, but for our present purpose it illustrates how easy it was to invent a god and watch the masses scurry to worship it. His scam began around 150 A.D. and lasted well beyond his death in 170 A.D., drawing the patronage of emperors and provincial governors as well as the commons. His cult may have even lasted into the 4th century, although the evidence is unclear.\nThe official story was that a snake-god with a human head was born as an incarnation of Asclepius, and Alexander was his keeper and intermediary. With this arrangement Alexander gave oracles, offered intercessory prayers, and even began his own mystery religion. Lucian tells us the inside story. Glycon was in fact a trained snake with a puppet head, and all the miracles surrounding him were either tall tales or the ingenious tricks of Alexander himself. But what might we think had there been no Lucian to tell us this? So credulous was the public as well as the government, that a petition to change the name of the town where the god lived, and to strike a special coin in his honor (Lucian, Alexander 58), was heeded, and we have direct confirmation of both facts: such coins have been found, dating from the reign of Antoninus Pius and continuing up into the 3rd century, bearing the unique image of a human-headed snake god. Likewise, the town of Abonuteichos was petitioned to be renamed Ionopolis, and the town is today known as Ineboli, a clear derivation. Even statues, inscriptions, and other carvings survive, attesting to this Alexander and his god Glycon and their ensuing cult (Culture and Society in Lucian, pp. 138, 143).\nAs for his influence, Lucian tells us that Severianus, the governor of Cappadocia, was killed in Armenia because he believed an oracle of Alexander's (27), and Rutilianus, the governor of Moesia and Asia, was also a devout follower, and even married Alexander's daughter. Indeed, Alexander's \"god\" was so popular that people rushed all the way from Rome to consult him (30), and even the emperor Marcus Aurelius sought his prophecy (48). From this it is all the more apparent that religious crazes were a dime a dozen in the time and place of the Gospels, helping to explain why a new and strange religion like Christianity could become so popular, and its claims--which to us sound absurd--could be so readily believed.\nThe final lesson from the case of Alexander and Peregrinus is that Lucian's skeptical debunking never persuaded any believers, showing that even the rare skeptic, no matter how convincing his arguments and evidence, could have no practical effect on the credulous. The vast majority would never read or hear anything he wrote, and most of those who did would dismiss it. Indeed, believers were hostile to critical thought and would shout the skeptics down and drive off even suspected doubters in their midst, as actually happened in the case of Alexander: before every ceremony, the congregation would cry \"Away with the Epicureans! Away with the Christians!\" (and atheists and unbelievers in general: 38) since these two groups had a reputation for trying to debunk popular religion (this hostility could even come to slander and violence: 25). In effect, this was like clamping their hands over their ears and humming, deliberately refusing even to hear reasonable arguments, much less to consider their force.\nFrom all of this one thing should be apparent: the age of Jesus was not an age of critical reflection and remarkable religious acumen. It was an era filled with con artists, gullible believers, martyrs without a cause, and reputed miracles of every variety. In light of this picture, the tales of the Gospels do not seem very remarkable. Even if they were false in every detail, there is no evidence that they would have been disbelieved or rejected as absurd by many people, who at the time had little in the way of education or critical thinking skills. They had no newspapers, telephones, photographs, or public documents to consult to check a story. If they were not a witness, all they had was a man's word. And even if they were a witness, the tales above tell us that even then their skills of critical reflection were lacking. Certainly, this age did not lack keen and educated skeptics--it is not that there were no skilled and skeptical observers. There were. Rather, the shouts of the credulous rabble overpowered their voice and seized the world from them, boldly leading them all into the darkness of a thousand years of chaos. Perhaps we should not repeat the same mistake. After all, the wise learn from history. The fool ignores it.\nGlenn Miller has written a rebuttal to this essay (\"Were the Miracles of Jesus invented by the Disciples/Evangelists?\" 2002), in response to which I changed some of the language above so as not to give a mistaken impression of my meaning. Miller's title has little to do with my essay, since I am not arguing here (even if I do elsewhere) that anyone in particular \"invented\" the miracles of Jesus. Rather, I am merely presenting a survey of the social and intellectual context in which those miracles came to be believed.\nAs to the remainder of Miller's criticism of this essay specifically, I plan to respond in a future rebuttal (which will be announced here). But one simple point must be made even now: almost all of Miller's relevant evidence comes from the educated or even scholarly elite (like Lucian), and thus in no way represents the average man or woman in antiquity, who by their very circumstance wrote nothing for Miller to examine. I would guess that skilled skeptics and skeptical viewpoints like those Miller finds probably could not be found in much more than 10% of the population of the time, if even that--but whose existence I acknowledged even in the original draft of this essay.\nThe fact that pagan miracle working is not much heard of today is in large part due to the more effective Christian propaganda during the Empire and, of course, a thousand years of censorship afterward. An excellent discussion of the former, and how it contributed to the eventual success of the Church, is given by Thomas Matthews in The Clash of the Gods: A Reinterpretation of Christian Art (1993). For a broad comparative study of holy men of all faiths (Christian, pagan, and Jewish) in the time of Jesus, an excellent source is Sage, Saint, and Sophist: Holy Men and their Associates in the Early Roman Empire, by Graham Anderson (1994). Both are highly recommended.\nThe most extensive study on the historicity of Apollonius as well as his cult and legend can be found in the otherwise dry work by Maria Dzielska, Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History, translated by Piotr Pienkowski (L'Erma di Bretschneider, 1986). Interested scholars should begin there. In particular, the source tradition on his magic \"talismans\" is a complicated affair, but their history and reluctant acceptance by the Church is discussed at great length by Dzielska in chapter 3. As for Lucian, his works about Peregrinus and Alexander are available in a very readable and engaging English translation in Lionel Casson's Selected Satires of Lucian (1962). These two stories are a very fun read, and well worth seeking out. An excellent survey and analysis of Lucian's works and his surrounding culture is available in Culture and Society in Lucian by C. P. Jones (1986). This is, in fact, a must-read for anyone interested in the contrast between free thought and gullibility in the Roman Empire. It has entire chapters dedicated to Peregrinus and Alexander. Finally, Lucian's Philopseudes (or \"Lover of Lies\") is a virtual treasure trove of examples of ancient credulity and superstition that is a must-read source on the subject (it can be found in vol. 3 of Lucian's works in the Loeb Classical Library).", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T18:52:02Z", "url": "https://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/kooks.html", "byte_size": 21251, "char_size": 21251}

{"text": "Since I\u2019m a lover of animals, both real and mythical, choosing an animal form that I would have the ability to shape-shift to is a nearly impossible choice for me.\nThere are many animal forms that are majestic, beautiful and powerful \u2013 which really sums up the whole reason I would want the ability to shape-shift in the first place. Aside from the fact that it\u2019s a magical ability, and we already know how receptive I am to magic in general, there\u2019s simply something about being that closely connected with an animal form/spirit/guide that I personally find enticing.\nIn an attempt to prevent this article from turning into a book of it\u2019s own, I\u2019m restricting myself to exploring three possible animal choices! Those would be dragon, wolf, and horse\u2026 nope, make that four, tiger as well, since this is my Chinese Zodiac animal.\nFor me, dragons are the be all of magic. They\u2019re majestic, powerful, graceful and simply to be revered. I know there are all sorts of tales and variations of dragons in literature across the decades. But for me, I\u2019m drawn to the best of everyone and everything. I rarely see the darkness even in dark beings. So when you strip away all the potential badness that goes with the image of a dragon, you are left with pure magnificence.\nHis scales glisten like diamonds; his claws are massive, sharp talons; his wings are perfectly symmetrical with an elegance to them that almost makes them seem delicate; even his tail is deceptively beautiful though it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to know the damage that could be done with a simple flick of the spiked tip.\nSo hands down, with the magic, flying, fire-breathing, power and grace \u2013 dragons would be my first choice.\nHaving said that, I\u2019ve always felt a profound connection to wolves, horses and tigers for various reasons.\nHorses have been one of my passions since before I was old enough to walk, that simply grew as I grew. The Black Stallion movie and book series were my go-to for years. I\u2019ve owned horses pretty much my entire life and their wisdom and intelligence fascinates me. They\u2019re incredibly loyal and let\u2019s face it \u2013 Unicorns are horses too, which brings us back to magic!\nI\u2019m not sure that I can explain my connection with wolves. It could perhaps be related to the fact that my parents bred Malamutes when I was a child and they were my real-live-teddy-bears as well as my protectors. People often relate wolves to loneliness, but the reality is that wolves travel in packs and there is something deeply admirable about the leader of the pack who tends to rule fairly but firmly. I\u2019m also very drawn to their protective nature, as I too am a protector.\nThen we have tigers, which clearly I have a connection with because of the Chinese Zodiac. Since I\u2019ve always been drawn to both the Western and Chinese Zodiacs, I\u2019ve read a fair bit of literature on being a \u201cTiger\u201d and in fairness, the vast majority of the descriptions associated with being a \u201cWood Tiger\u201d are very accurate, so there is a level of logics behind being able to shape-shift into tiger form.\nBut even after speculating on all four of these, I still come back to dragons. So maybe this really wasn\u2019t as nearly impossible as I first thought it would be!\nIf you could shape-shift, what animal form would you choose?\nShe never ceases to amaze me. Those are 100% her words and insight \u2013 and to think, I\u2019ve had two people try to suggest to me that the voices of the teens in my novel aren\u2019t realistic\u2026 Anyone who has read my first book will very likely feel a slight draw to the text above, since it\u2019s been the teens in my life over the years who have significantly influenced my writing.\nBut I digress (she just truly amazes me at times\u2026) \u2013 getting back to shape-shifting\u2026 what would be your animal form of choice?\n\u2190 Never be late again with Teleportation?\nHmmm\u2026my Chinese zodiac animal is rat. I\u2019ll give that a miss, I think haha!\nI don\u2019t really like cats as pets. I think they\u2019re a bit arrogant and self-serving. To be a cat, though, that\u2019s a whole other ball-game. Certainly of all the domesticated animals, they\u2019ve got it the best. They can come and go as they please \u2013 most have even got their own little door. They don\u2019t have to go out into the snow and rain to pee. They get fed and fussed whenever they so desire but when they don\u2019t, they have their own independent lives. They often even have 2 or 3 homes to choose from, 2 or 3 families, and 2 or 3 sets of feeders/fussers \ud83d\ude09 I think cats have got the best of both worlds \u2013 the comforts of domesticity and freedom and independence.\nA horse \u2013 I used to gallop around pretending I was one when I was a child.\nOne of two if I could shape shift I think a dragon cause they can fly and breadth fire.\nOr a lioness they are fierce and protective.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T13:09:10Z", "url": "https://tanyajones.ca/shape-shift-animal-pick/", "byte_size": 4848, "char_size": 4755}

Where are you going???\u201dWhile I wave burning torches at the circling, slavering newshounds, here is some information about the Mass Effect Andromeda [official site] multiplayer which comes via Game Informer and their hands-on preview.\nThe big thing I\u2019m taking away from their article is that the single player and multiplayer modes are interlinked but one does not depend on the other. It sounds like they\u2019re going for a softer approach than with Mass Effect 3. In ME3 you had a multiplayer mode where completing those co-op missions impacted your single player ending. As I recall, it wasn\u2019t *mandatory* to do the co-op stuff and you could still get the perfect ending but it became difficult to do so and thus the push towards co-op got a bit heavy-handed. That said, I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t feel pushed to do any co-op and I think I took the synthesis ending which means my galactic readiness must have been alright.\nWith Andromeda the idea seems to be that you shouldn\u2019t feel obliged to play multiplayer if you don\u2019t want to, but that multiplayer isn\u2019t entirely separated from the single player experience either.\nObviously this is just me thinking aloud now, but from that I\u2019m imagining maybe some resources/in-game credits you can get from multiplayer that make some aspects in single-player a bit easier, or maybe just give you cosmetics you can wear as you wander about. There also seems to be the option that reminds me of Dragon Age where you could send people to go do side missions on your behalf. There\u2019s also another game I can\u2019t think of the name of right now which does something similar \u2013 you could send people off from your party to go do things and they would level up a bit. Oh! Pillars Of Eternity! That was it.\nGoing back to Andromeda, it sounds like there have also been changes to things like cooldown timers (switching from global to individual) and some twiddling to stop people hiding in one spot. The latter is a pretty standard tweak for any PvP or PvE experience. You want players to have to move around rather than camp a single spot. It happened multiple times across Destiny patches and expansions, especially with group PvE stuff where encounters would get remixed and safe zones became noticeably less safe. You can read more about those aspects plus jetpack stuff, prestige and so on over on GI.\nNow, can someone let me out of the news trap before I kill anymore innocent newshounds with my singing and torch flailing?\nTagged with BioWare, multiplayer, Mass Effect Andromeda.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T07:58:59Z", "url": "https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/11/28/mass-effect-andromeda-multiplayer/", "byte_size": 2889, "char_size": 2853}

{"text": "Scand J Work Environ Health. 39(4):361-368.\nOur previous work has suggested that the incidence of any occurrence of injury leave among police officers is higher on night shifts. In this study, we extended our inquiry to determine whether the incidence of long-term injury leave varies across shifts.\nPolice officers (N=419) from an urban department were included in the analysis. Daily payroll work history data from 1994\u20132010 was collected. Injury leave duration was examined ranging from \u22651\u2013\u226590 days. Poisson regression models were used to compute incidence rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) of long-term injury.\nCumulative incidence of injury for different durations of leave defined as \u22651, \u22655, \u226510, \u226515, \u226530, and \u226590 days were 61.3%, 45.4%, 39.9%, 33.9%, 26.5%, and 9.6% respectively. Age-and gender adjusted IRR of long-term injury (\u226590 days) for night versus day shifts was IRR 3.12, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.35\u20137.21 and IRR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04\u20134.68, for night versus afternoon shifts. Among all durations examined, the largest IRR was for injury \u226590 days, night versus day shifts (IRR 3.12, 95% CI 1.35\u20137.21).\nNight shift work was significantly associated with long-term injury among police officers after adjustment for age and gender. Although type of injury was not available, it is possible that variation in injury type across shifts might account for some of this association.\nJ Occup Environ Med. 59(11):1084-1088.\nJ Occup Environ Med. 58(3):e66-e71.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T04:32:08Z", "url": "https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/32051", "byte_size": 1511, "char_size": 1481}

My friend from Switserland send me the book back; so now I can read it myself. She realy liked it, so I'm even more eager to read it than I already was!!!\nI just loved the book!!!!!\nFran tells her story with such humor.\ngood reading material it is.\nAgain thanks for the book, FamFatale!!\nAnd there was interest for a bookring! Today Fran will go to the first person in the ring: Arja.\nHave a safe and wonderful journey, Fran!!!\nE-mile mentioned this book and I thought it'd be interesting to read more about Fran's life. Might take a few weeks, as I suddenly had a pile of ring books arrive at the same time.\nI never realized how many other shows and films Fran Drescher must have worked on, before and during The Nanny. Also, I had not expected her to be so obnoxious and eccentric all the time in her behaviour and writing. IMHO this gets a bit annoying, even though that is who she is (or how she wants to present herself).\nE-mile, can you please tell me who to send the book to next?\nGister in de brievenbus gekregen via Arja. Hartelijk bedankt voor het langsbrengen. Ben er meteen in begonnen, was speciaal even in niets nieuws begonnen omdat ik wist dat ie eraan zat te komen. Ben benieuwd. Leuk dat het boek helemaal uit de US komt!\nWhat a lovely book to read and nice photo's too! Very funny. A real feel-good-story as far as I'm concerned, really liked it.\nShe sounds gratefull for the carrier she has and doesn't take her success for granted. I'll enjoy the episodes of The Nanny even more now I know the whole history and details behind it!\nI will bring the book to Tiekie this week asap.\nGot this book today from Pietenpadje. I am very looking forward to reading this book, so I will move my other books to a dark place and settle down tonight! Thank you E-mile for this lovely ring-book!!\nI am sending this book to the next person on the list. I have got no time to read it and I don't want to keep it here for too long.\nFran arrived on my doormat today!\nI'm really looking forward to reading this book.\nThanks for sending it Tiekie, and perhaps you can still read it after me?\nBy the way, nice to know that this book comes all the way from America!\nFinished it and what a fun book to read!\nAt times I really had to laugh out loud. And it's really written in her voice, literally... you actually hear her saying all these sentences!\nThe only thing that was nagging me whilst reading the book was the way she talked about her husband and her wonderful marriage... soon after this book was published they got divorced!!\nMaybe she wrote about that in her second book? I guess I have to read that as well!\nI'll contact Tiekie to ask if she has time to read it now, otherwise this book will be off to muizz.\nFran is on her way to Muizz!\nSorry for the late journal entry. I found the parcel in a stack of mail when I came home from a couple of days abroad and then I forgot to register it. Luckily Mirre sent me a reminder that she hadn't heard wether the book has arrived. Well, it has! Probably it will take some time before I am able to read it, because there are some other books screaming for attention as well.\nThanks for ringing the book, and Mirre, thanks for sending the book and for the reminder.\nImagine you are at a dinner party and the woman sitting next to you doesn't stop talking. She keeps on talking about her career, clothes, celebrities she's met, clothes, her succesful television show, clothes, her apearance at David Letterman shows and how funny she was there, clothes, etc. You don't want to be impolite and you make some encouraging noises, and in the mean time you are looking for a place to hide.\nThat's how I felt when reading this book. Normally I love (auto)biographies, but this one I didn't enjoy. Someone who is able to spend 6 pages about the preparations for a photo shoot (how her make up, hair and clothes were) can't keep my interest. I'm really sorry. Needless to say that I didn't finish this book.\nNow the book will continue its journey. It'll go to Sarana.\nWhat a lovely and funny book! I've read it while spending the Easter weekend with my parents and I kept calling out to them \"Ooo, did you know that...\" and \"You've got to hear this...\". I had no idea that so much about The Nanny was based on Fran's own life. I loved her stories, especially the down-to-earth-ness of them, and the fact that she wasn't afraid to tell her silliest stories or show her most unflattering pictures... A very sympathetic woman, as far as you can tell through this book.\nI'm shocked to read in Mirre's Journal Entry that she's divorced now, the way she describes her marriage it's hard to believe that it fell apart soon afterwards!\nThanks for ringing the book, E-mile! I'm PM'ing Nandaaah now.\nEdit: I'm terribly sorry for the long delay, the book was mailed out today.\nAnd the book has arrived, just started in another, so I'll probably start in this book somewhere in the next week.\nI've finished the book today in the hot sun. It was an O.K. book to read.\nJust as Arja, I didn't know she did this many other shows and films. And too bad she divorced, since her mariage seems good in the book, but unexpecting things can happen. The book will be off to the next reader as soon as I got an adress to send it to.\nAnd I got the book now! Thanx Nandaaah for sending it and E-mile for ringing (?) it. I allready started in it because my last book was just finished. Fun to know that her parents and sister's names in the Nanny came out off real life. That Chester was her dog, I knew allready. I will try to finish it before the Castricum-meeting.\nGelukt! Geweldig van genoten! En nu The Nanny weer op tv is kijk ik toch met *iets* andere ogen. Bedankt voor het ringen E-mile. Ze komt morgen bij je terug.\n\"What I learned about myself, the depth of my relationships, and cancer -tests, treatment, recovery and follow-up- could fill a book. So here it is.\n* back to E-mile. <-- Fran is back home!!!!\nposted Fran today, so the ring can continue..\nFran has arrived in Gouda! I'm looking forward to reading this book and am pleased to see it has pictures in it! Is has been a while since I read a book containing pictures.\nHi guys, perhaps you already know it, but since a few weeks there is another comedy on RTL4 on sunday afternoon with/about Fran!! I saw it for the first time last sunday and wanted to let you know that it's out there.\nNa 'The Nanny' is Fran Drescher terug met een nieuwe komedie. In 'Living with Fran' is Fran een gescheiden vrouw die geniet van de nieuwe weg die haar leven is ingeslagen. Haar nieuwe liefde Riley is fantastisch, geweldig en jong, heel erg jong. Hun relatie is ingewikkeld vanwege het feit dat de kinderen van Fran bijna even oud zijn als hun nieuwe 'stiefvader'. Het nieuwe huishouden van Fran mag dan niet traditioneel zijn en soms heel lastig, toch weet ze zeker dat ze het niet anders zou willen doen.\n'Living with Fran', vanaf zondag 11 juni, 17.00 - 17.30 uur, RTL 4.\nToday Fran arrived at my doormat, together with 2(!) other books...Which makes the count of ringbooks that arrived here in 3 days: 7...I think I'll need to ask my boss for a reading leave-of-absense.\nAnyway, although not all the stories were equally entertaining I enjoyed reading the book. It was really written in her voice, like Mirre said!\nI can't wait to read the other book!\nThanks for re-opening the ring E-mile!\nI'll send it to Yinny asap!\nFound it in the mailbox yesterday!\nThank you, E-mile for sharing this book and Enitnaj for sending this book!\nYes, she is boasting about all the famous people she met, the people she knows, the clothes she wears, blablabla. But she does it so innocently, so charming, that it isn't (very) annoying.\nThis book is already on its way to the next reader.\nThe book is here! I'll start reading it right away, because the book I'm currently reading is not to my taste.\nThe book is badly damaged, I'll try to repair some of it.\nI never watched the Nanny because I dislike sitcoms and canned laughter, but this book was neat. Miss Drecher sure has a lot of energy!\nThanks for the sweet card you left me in the book Yinny! I'll keep using it as a bookmark.\nI'm mailing this book to Redfloor today. Happy reading!\nLag in mijn brievenbus. Ben heel erg benieuwd ernaar. Er zijn nog wel enkele boeken die eerst aan de beurt zijn. Dutch-flybabe, je hebt het keurig gerestaureerd! Dank ook voor de kaart.\nEdit: Ere wie ere toekomt, Dutch-flybabe heeft het boekje gerestaureerd, niet Yinny.\nWat een leuk boek om te lezen. Allereerst door het formaat. Het is een lekker kleine pocket met kleine letters. Het paste makkelijk in mijn tas, zelfs als deze al vol zat. Daardoor kon ik doorlezen in de trein. Alle boeken zouden in dit formaat verkrijgbaar moeten zijn.\nDaarnaast is het ook gewoon heel erg leuk om te lezen over het leven van een van mijn favoriete actrices. Heel grappig om te lezen dat haar eigen ouders ook Sylvia en Morty heten en dat er meer parallellen zijn. Fijn dat Fran uiteindelijk een succesvolle carriere heeft. Ik bekijk de Nanny nu met heel andere ogen. Ik ben benieuwd naar deel twee, al vermoed ik, gezien de inhoud, dat dat deel lang niet zo hilarisch zal zijn.\nHaven't read it yet but will so very soon.

I think it'll be a quick read!\nThanks for ringing and sending it to me!\nOp de post naar de volgende lezer!\nHeb dit boek voordat ik op vakantie ging uitgelezen.

{"text": "Glasgow tower block on fire: Eight people injured during the huge blaze-one year after the Grenfell tour tragedy.\nA commercial court\u2019s flat at Gorbals in Glasgow was damaged by a massive fire this morning. More than 12 fire engine and three accident response teams scrambled to the scene just before 8 am.\nThe fire is believed to have started in the kitchen of a 14th floor flat. Smoke was seen billowing across the city out of the top floors of the flats in the Gorbals area.\nThe Scottish Fire and Rescue officer in charge of the incident, Alan Fairbairn, said that firefighters were alerted at 07:58 this June 14 to reports of a fire within a flat in Glasgow.\nCrews were relocated at the leisure centre, a few steps away from the damaged flat.\n\u201cA total of eight casualties were passed into the care of the Scottish Ambulance Service and transported to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital,\u201d a firefighter spokesman said.\nOne tenant of the damaged flat, Mrs Diane Zeufack, was trapped on the fifth floor where she lives with her family.\nMr Zeufack, a resident of the damaged flat.\nMr Zeufack was getting the kids ready for school when she received a call from her husband asking her to remain in the flat. She said: \u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d but she had to be strong to reassure the kids.\nThey later managed to escape by the stairs. \u201cThe journey to the ground floor was the longest ever,\u201d the mum of three said as all this was reminding her of the Grenfell Tour\u2019s tragedy, she added. More shaken than injured, they all got out safe. However, the trauma remains.\nThe First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is the local MSP for the Gorbals, tweeted that Gorbals fire was entirely under control. She also thanked the firefighters. The firemen remain on the scene as a precaution against any further risk, the First Minister said.\nThe Gorbals\u2019 fire occurred one year exactly after the horrific blaze in Grenfell Tower; west London where 72 people died.\nA minute\u2019s silence has been observed across the country today at midday following the London\u2019s tower block disaster.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T11:24:03Z", "url": "http://www.theafrobeanechos.com/glasgow-tower-block-on-fire-eight-people-injured-during-the-huge-blaze-one-year-after-the-grenfell-tour-tragedy/", "byte_size": 2083, "char_size": 2061}

I just don\u2019t know what to name this adorable lantern.\nThis is a quick Halloween craft, you can do if you can\u2019t find a pumpkin, you can use an orange, only if you have one.\nStart by using the knife to chopping the top the orange off.\nNote: Ensure you do not cut orange in half, chop a bit less than 3/4, because it will be differcult to scoop the insides out if the opening is small.\nNote: You may find it easier to cut in between the flesh and the skin, than cut the flesh in half before using the spoon to scoop. Make sure you do not cut in to the skin.\nDraw on the features using a marker.\nNote: You can use any pen/ colour you like. I used permeant because it shows up better and doesn\u2019t rub off, when carving.\nUse scissor to cut the features.\nPut tissue under and inside orange to absorb the moister.\nNote: You do not have o use the microwave, I used it to dry the orange and to make it wrinkly and old.\nNote: If you are using the microwave, do not microwave for too long, you can burn it unless you want the burn effect, or the lid/ top will shrink like mines. I suggest you to microwave both for 30secs and take the lid/ top out and microwave the rest for another 30secs.\nPersonalise your Halloween lantern, I gave mines stitches.\nGood luck and have fun!

{"text": "A strong V8, four-on-the-floor, and a great color setup are the reasons that attracted you to this 1966 Chevrolet Chevy II Nova. But then you discover the super clean presentation everywhere, right down to the undercarriage, on this real-deal Super Sport \u2013 that\\'s what makes this one irresistible.\nRendered in the Marina Blue, this Nova has earned the right to share the legendary color with its Camaro and Corvette siblings. This classic color has plenty of modern gloss, so it looks terrific when you take it out for a sunny day cruise. Plus, we love these second-generation Novas, because they perfectly added some of Chevy\\'s \\'60s-style muscle car aggression without ever losing its sleeper attitude. The subtle overhand of the front fenders, the sporty kick-up in the rear ones, and the fastback roofline are all attractive without being too brazen. Plus, you get all the correct vintage Nova details like the right Super Sport badging, full rocker trim, and wraparound chrome bumpers front and rear. It\\'s a head-turner right down to the iconic Rally wheels.\nThere was a solid investment inside to keep the factory-correct black interior looking good and feeling fresh. Everything looks factory original, from the chrome accents on the black door panels, to the heat/defrost controls, to the push-button AM radio that\\'s still on display. You should even check out the trunk that has the correct matting and even the instructions affixed to the inside lid. When you slide into the driver\\'s bucket seat, the black and chrome steering wheel feels grippy in your hands, and beyond that are the wide, clear gauges you love on a 60s American classic like this. But when you grab the Hurst shifter, you\\'ll instantly realize you like this Nova SS for more than just nostalgia.\nThe code 18 in the VIN lets you know this is a real-deal V8 Super Sport Nova, and so you\\'re going to love what you see when you lift the hood \u2013 it\\'s a correct 327 cubic-inch V8. And when you look beyond the style of the polished components like the valve covers and air topper, you\\'re going to find some great performance upgrades, too. This has a Holley four-barrel carburetor, performance aluminum intake, and a rumbling glasspack-style dual exhaust. Best of all, you have complete control over this lightweight and powerful package thanks to the four-speed manual transmission.\nA real-deal Super Sport Nova with a terrific presentation and a powerful V8 package. It\\'s a turn-key ready classic that\\'s ready to turn heads this weekend.

{"text": "Some words remain etched on your mind no matter when you read them. That\u2019s the power of words. I particularly believe in these words of Paulo Coelho \u2013 \u201cWhen you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.\u201d That\u2019s perhaps what had lead me to believe that if you truly want something (and if you work for it), it will definitely happen.\nOur instincts are often right. When we tend to ignore it, we end up making a mistake. However, when your intuition fails in certain rare instances, you look for signs that help you decide whether you should go for something or not. Remember how you spend all day wondering where to travel for your next holiday and you suddenly see an advertisement of a traveler enjoying his stay in Switzerland. It looks like the world is try to tell you something.\nBeing hungry on a weekend is extremely dangerous. When Zomato and Swiggy are just a touch away, things could get complicated if you act on an impulse. The consequences are frightening. So we should exercise utmost caution, and also perhaps (senior) adult supervision , while adding items to our cart.\nI don\u2019t cook the most Instagram-worthy meals every weekend, but roughly plan it on Fridays to avoid spending 2 hours discussing what to cook. I avoid cooking more than 2 meals a day, so apart from breakfast and lunch we normally eat out once a week or head over to mom\u2019s place for some cozy meal. So the main meals are taken care of. It\u2019s the cravings between the meals that tend to push me towards Zomato or Swiggy.\nOn one such weekend, my husband and I quickly finished our weekend chores and settled to eat a nice healthy, home-cooked meal. Things were fine till my mind started asking for something more. No, I didn\u2019t want another serving of what we were eating. This time the call was for something sweet or crispy, something which people would not consider healthy. When I told my husband about this, he asked me to order online as he was scared I would then ask him to cook something. I was furious with him for letting me cheat so easily and told him he should help me in times like these when I was craving for junk food.\nI wasn\u2019t sure if I welcomed this unexpected testing of my will power (not really sure if I had any in the first place!). I tried to divert myself with some movie and switched on the TV. Tata Sky told me I could subscribe to some new food channel. Strike 1. I wanted to stay away from all cookery shows and in the random channel I switched to, Sanjeev Kapoor was revealing the secrets behind making a very appetizing biryani. Strike 2. You know how you go someplace and the first person you bump into is the person you wanted to avoid. That\u2019s exactly how it felt. Anyway, I was scanning through the channels checking for a decent movie and settled for a movie on Romedy Now- No Reservations. Guess what the hero and the heroine did? They were chefs at this amazing restaurant and they were whipping up mouth-watering dishes and even delectable desserts. Strike 3.\nI could bear it no longer and finally gave in. I usually decide quickly and in a matter of seconds, I set my mind on having an ice cream. We headed to Amadora, our favourite ice cream place in Chennai and treated ourselves to some delicious flavours of ice creams (dark chocolate sorbet and salted caramel).\nThere is a limit to the temptations a human being can resist. And when it comes to foodies like me, it doesn\u2019t take much effort to get tempted. Initially I choose to ignore my instincts which was telling me to satiate my cravings. However there were obvious signs everywhere that were impossible to ignore. I knew the world was trying to tell me something. How could I not listen to what it was trying to convey? It\u2019s important that we follow the orders of the world. I was pretty sure these messages were intended for me. Wondering how I\u2019m that confident? You see, while some eat to live, I belong to the group which lives to eat!\nSo, watch out for these signs. You never know how the world might try to help you.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T14:47:27Z", "url": "https://ashwinicn.com/2017/04/08/when-your-world-lends-a-hand/?shared=email&msg=fail", "byte_size": 4057, "char_size": 4029}

{"text": "A few months ago, our office switched its e-mail over to a business version of gmail. One of the features of our new e-mail is that a little colored circle is displayed by each person\u2019s name showing whether he or she is online.\nI have to admit, I really like it when I see other people on staff with the green circle by their names. According to Google, this means they are \u201cavailable.\u201d Because I work from home, it\u2019s easy to start feeling isolated and alone as I complete my tasks each week. But when I see those green lights next to other people\u2019s names it makes me feel like I\u2019m part of a team.\nOne person might be in the office. Someone else is at Caribou. Another person might be working from home. But we are all working together. For the same goal. And I don\u2019t feel so alone.\nYesterday my green light was on almost all day. The boys were at camp. My daughter had a play date. The toddler was happily playing or napping most of they day. So I took advantage of the time to get caught up on a ton of work.\nI was sending and receiving e-mail and working away as if everything was peachy. But I was fighting a nasty cold and felt horrible all day. I was tempted to set a custom message by my green light: \u201cCough, cough. Sneeze, sneeze. Please feel sorry for me.\u201d It just seemed wrong that my green dot was shining brightly as if everything was perfect when I was really struggling.\nAnd isn\u2019t that how it often goes in our real, offline world, as well?\nMost of us at least try to put on the green light when we are out in public. We smile and joke. We pull ourselves together. We walk around with our big \u201cavailable\u201d button shining brightly. But wouldn\u2019t it be kind of nice if we could change our status to put out a warning of what is really happening on the inside?\nLast Saturday, I was watching my daughter\u2019s soccer game, along with the toddler and my 8-year-old son. My husband had to take the 10-year-old to another field for his game. It was hot. We were hungry. It was naptime. It was humid. There wasn\u2019t a shade tree in sight.\nIt had been a struggle to get everyone where they needed to be, and I was just relieved that the toddler had found a little hill about 10 feet away from me that was keeping her busy. She loved marching up the tiny incline and then running back down it. At the top of the hill, a woman was sitting in a lawn chair next to a building, which was giving her a little shade.\nMy son was hovering nearby to make sure the toddler didn\u2019t wander too far or fall down.\nMy son nodded, as I headed over to prove the baby really did have a mother.\n\u201cWell, you better put that baby in the stroller before her head gets sunburned,\u201d she ordered.\nI assured the woman I had covered her in sunscreen.\nAt that moment, my light turned bright red. My green light was done. Off. Finished.\nI wasn\u2019t going to bother explaining that I had tried six times to get the toddler to keep a hat on her head. It would serve no purpose to try to tell her that I\u2019m neurotic about applying sunscreen. Or that confining the 18-month-old to a stroller for an hour when it was 98 degrees outside would have created such a loud protest that she would be begging me to release the child from her confinement.\nI was just relieved we had succeeded in getting all four children where they needed to be at the right time. I was happy that no one was crying. I was overjoyed the toddler was having fun running up and down the hill so I could actually observe a few minutes of the game. I had zero desire for anyone in the family to get a sunburn, and even though it did look like she was probably going to be burned to a crisp, I had enough experience as her mom to trust that the extra coating of sunscreen was going to work.\nThe whole interaction was a good reminder to me. I need to take more time to find out what people have gone through to get to the place they are. They might look pretty and put together with their nice green light shining on the outside. But a harsh word or an unsolicited comment might just knock them over.\nI need to remember that not everyone is \u201cavailable\u201d for whatever I might feel like throwing their way. Green light, or not.\nAnd it's sad that all I took away from that is how I wanna pop that lady in the head for the whole sunburn thing!! I have a saying when it comes to obvious comments from others that degrade my abilities and it's \"big dummy\"! When someone let's me know I'm \"doin it wrong\" I always whisper to myself \"yeah ya big dummy\"!!! Then laugh at them cuz they r really the \"big dummy\"!! This doesnt make sense I bet\u2026 I do that often!\nOh, Andrea\u2026 You totally crack me up! Thanks for making me laugh!!\nGreat post Emily!

Likewise, it\u2019s false economy to buy a budget machine if you intend to row everyday for an hour!\nFor more help on making the right decision see our guide to buying a rower , and also check out our advice for buying a used model .\nIf it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve last been active, it\u2019s advisable to ease yourself gently into physical exercise.

{"text": "1. Find a group of AAEM members in your region who are dedicated to the mission statement of AAEM.\nThere must be a minimum of 100 AAEM members in the state or region to be considered. Once this is confirmed, you will need to identify committed, enthusiastic EPs to name for the board of directors. Name a president, vice-president, and a secretary-treasurer. This will be the Executive Committee. Then name a board of directors, anywhere from four to six individuals. (Remember you want this to be an even number so that when the entire board meets for a vote you have an odd number when you add the Executive Committee, so that you don't end up with tie votes.) When the members of the board are identified, you will be asked to submit a form listing the board of directors for the new chapter division. This will then be approved by the AAEM board of directors.\nThis is an easy process as you may use the bylaws template and make appropriate changes. The AAEM office will be glad to supply you with the electronic copy of the template and assist you with this process. The bylaws must be submitted to the AAEM board for approval.\nThe chapter division board will be sent operational documents for review and approval. Some require signatures from more than one executive committee member, so please plan this process accordingly.\nYou will want to buy a copy of Rules of Order by Dr. James E. Davis to run the board meetings and conference calls. This edition was selected by national AAEM due to the ease of use as compared to Robert's Rules. This book may be found at any local bookstore or may be ordered online.\nWe have found that email is a very efficient way to communicate. I would encourage all officers and board members to have an email address. One or two face-to-face meetings a year are important, but having conference calls in the interim helps the board take care of business in a timely and less expensive manner.\nYou will want to be recognized by your state medical society and get involved in the legislative process. Your state medical society will be able to help you with this. I suggest the president (at the very least) be a member of the state medical society. They often have annual legislative leadership conferences, which you may attend to find out what is happening in your state. This is your opportunity to meet and discuss issues of local concern with state politicians.\nSo what are you waiting for?

{"text": "Over the past five years, I\u2019ve analyzed data on a wide range of products from lip balm to dog food, from potato chips to kefir. And while categories of interest have changed, my general best practices for analyzing the data remain constant. Data can be complicated and challenging, but, if you know how to harness it, transform it, and understand its meaning, it can be a game-changer with immense value to your business.\nAs a part of SPINS\u2019 Brand Growth Solutions team, I work with clients every day to bring the data to life and make it actionable for their businesses. While I can\u2019t reveal all of my team\u2019s secrets in this post, I will lay out three insider tips that we use to transform data on a daily basis.\nBecause there\u2019s often so many factors that can drive business, it can be overwhelming to know where to start digging for answers. I find it helpful to generate a list of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) probable hypotheses to easily identify the top contenders and eliminate those that are less likely. This planning and forethought always saves me time because it provides a targeted list of analyses to consider, and every analysis assists in either proving or disproving the most likely hypothetical causes. By setting myself up for success on the front end, I find more time to generate insights and implications on the back end.\nIt always helps to understand the whole picture. It\u2019s not enough to say that a brand is growing 10%. I always make data points relevant to my audience by benchmarking it back to something. Is that 10% accelerated or decelerated from the prior year? Is that 10% higher or lower than the category? Is that 10% better or worse than projected estimates? The easiest way to make data mean something is by making a comparative \u201cthan\u201d statement.\nVisuals are the KEY to bringing data to life and telling the story. As data analysts, it\u2019s our job to make the numbers meaningful. We\u2019re doing the data a disservice every time we copy and paste a raw data chart from Excel onto a slide. To mitigate this, I find it most helpful to ask myself, which hypothesis will I demonstrate here? (See Tip #1.) Then my follow-up question is, what kind of chart or visualization is going to best represent this data and make the point clear? The simplest rule to follow is to visualize one point per slide. Finally, when I make the point with a visually descriptive chart, I always highlight the insight for my audience, as well. In addition to the charts and visualizations, I know it\u2019s important for me to narrate the story in the data to help my audience fully understand each insight and implication.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T02:50:22Z", "url": "https://www.spins.com/three-tips-for-translating-data-to-insights/", "byte_size": 2670, "char_size": 2648}

{"text": "The Haverford School is proud to host the TENTH Annual Checking for Cancer Lacrosse Invitational, featuring premier ranked boys\u2019 lacrosse programs and girls\u2019 lacrosse programs. All of whom will compete in the spirit of the game while promoting the important cause of cancer awareness. Our mission of cancer awareness is particularly personal to our head coach John Nostrant.\nJohn Nostrant, coach of The Haverford School, was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 years ago, and Georgetown Prep coach, Kevin Giblin, is now in remission from his colon cancer. John and Kevin were roommates in college and line mates on the lacrosse field as players. They remain the best of friends. Both highly acclaimed coaches helped coach the United States U-19 Men\u2019s Team to the International World Federation Championship in British Columbia in 2008. Each, however, has had to quietly but courageously endure private ordeals that are all too common to the thousands of individuals who are diagnosed with cancer each year.\nProstate cancer is the most common type of cancer found in American men, other than skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 217,730 new cases of prostate cancer in the United States in 2010. About 32,050 men will die of this disease this year. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. One man in 6 will get prostate cancer during his lifetime, and 1 man in 36 will die of this disease. This disease starts in the prostate and if caught before it spreads is highly treatable and curable.\nExcluding skin cancers, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimated that about 102,900 new cases of colon cancer (49,470 in men and 51,370 in women) and 39,670 new cases of rectal cancer (22,620 in men and 17,050 in women) were diagnosed in 2010. This is a disease that tends to be slow growing and always starts as a polyp which can be found by colonoscopy. Proper screening should yield an almost perfect cure rate.\nThe good news is that the outlook for individuals diagnosed with prostate and colorectal is better than ever, and the key to a positive prognosis is screening and early detection. Beginning by age 50, men and women who are at average risk for developing colorectal cancer should begin a pattern of routine screening for cancer prevention. We hope that greater awareness will lead to an appreciation of the importance of screening and heightened vigilance in our battle against these curable diseases.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T02:45:48Z", "url": "http://www.checkingforcancer.org/content/cfc-history", "byte_size": 2577, "char_size": 2571}

{"text": "Mac McCorkle runs a bar and helps out his partner, who is a agent with the CIA.\nWhen McCorkle took his life savings and began to open a small pub in Bonn, Germany, after being discharged from the army, he wasn't looking for a partner. That didn't stop Mike Padillo from dropping in, handing him a check for half the value of the place, and telling Mac he could either accept the offer or see the opening delayed forever in red tape.\nKnowing he really had no choice, McCorkle accepted gracefully, albeit unhappily. To his credit, Padillo, forced by his own superiors to make the extortion, had the decency to be embarrassed.\nSo began the partnership between the two men, one that would quickly turn into a life-long friendship. Mike Padillo worked for the government (probably the CIA). When not on assignment, he helped run the bar, which grew over the years in success and made both a considerable amount of money. But every couple of months, he would show up, tell McCorkle he'd be gone for a while, and a week or a month would go by with him gone.\nSuch was the basis for the series which probably was never meant to be one. The ending of the first book made it pretty clear that was it. Then the book won for Mr. Thomas an Edgar for the best first novel of 1966. I'm sure that's when the publishers began to demand a sequel.\nThe sequel came the next year but this time Mr. Thomas apparently withstood the pressure for more and used his incredible talent on other ideas. Six books, including three in a different non-spy series followed before the pair of McCorkle and Padillo were heard from again. And then it would be 19 years more before the last in the series was written.\nThrough the years, the two unwavering qualities of this series remained the close friendship between McCorkle and Padillo and the terrific writing skills of Ross Thomas.\nMcCorkle discovers that his friend and partner has been sacrificed by his superiors in an exchange with the Soviets to get back two defectors. He realizes he is the only one willing to risk it all for Padillo.\nHappily married and living in Washington, McCorkle would have been happy to meet his old friend Padillo if McCorkle's wife had been kidnapped to force Padillo to kill someone.\nLong out of the game, both men are less than anxious to help protect the future king of a country rich with oil but Padillo owes a huge favor to the ones doing the asking.\nThe death of a CIA agent didn't raise too much of a fuss until it is learned he wrote a tell-all book which someone wants buried, possibly along with the agent's son who might have it. The son asks Padillo and McCorkle for help.\nA fellow spy-fiction fan and friend of mine was almost jumping for joy when he got his hands on \"The Backup Men\" in 1972-3, shouting, \"They're back! McCorkle and Padillo!\" You would have thought I'd slapped him by his expression when I asked, \"Who?\"\nAfter having the first book literally thrust into my hands later and reading the first few pages, I knew I'd never have to ask that question again. I was as hooked as my friend (thank you, Bob Walker, wherever you are!).\nIt isn't hard to understand why anyone who likes spy-fi would love this series. Mr. Thomas's skill as an author are without a doubt. The man won TWO Edgars. Most writers don't win any. He had two. And deserved them both handily.\nFurthermore, the characters are awesomely interesting and developed, the style is both exciting and wry, the locales are perfectly presented, and the plots just make sense. What more can you ask for, except more adventures.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Thomas' passing makes that impossible but I like to believe that McCorkle and Padillo are still out there, serving drinks and saving the day.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T20:56:01Z", "url": "https://spyguysandgals.com/sgShowChar.aspx?id=602", "byte_size": 3721, "char_size": 3721}

So, to give you an example from last year, when Gordon Brown was trying to get re-elected as British Prime Minister, he was overheard calling an old lady a \"bigot\" \u2013 a very strong word for somebody who is intolerant and close-minded. Anyway, this was a big scandal and it came to be known in the media as 'bigotgate'.\nWang Fei: Bigotgate. That sounds almost a little bit funny.\nWilliam: Yes, you're right. I think using -gate on the end of a word can make it seem a little humorous. This term -gate is used more in the USA, but another recent example from the UK is 'Climategate' \u2013 that was when some emails and other documents from a university in England led to people asking questions about the way that scientists researched climate change. Climategate.\nWang Fei: So, can we use \u2013gate in normal English conversation too?\nMan A: Have you seen Mark recently?\nMan B: Mark \u2013 he hasn't spoken to me since beergate!\nMan A: Beergate? What do you mean?\nMan B: We had a big argument because I said Mark never bought a round of beer in the pub! He got very upset and went home.\nWang Fei: So in that example, the speaker coined the word beergate to describe an argument about paying for beer!\nWilliam: Yeah, which is obviously very silly. But of course, this suffix -gate is used in very serious situations too. And it was thanks to members of the free press, including the Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, that the public came to know about Watergate.\nWang Fei: Yes.

The advanced prototype demonstrated integration of this key technology with other innovative sub-systems during flight operations in autumn of this year.\nThis evidence of technological maturity leads Aeros into fleet development with two configurations of the innovative aircraft this decade - a smaller 66-tonne capacity vehicle, ML866, and a larger 250-tonne capacity vehicle, ML868.\nParties in Brussels were particularly interested in the Aeroscraft's environmentally friendly benefits, burning only a third of the fuel of conventional cargo aircraft.\nAlso discussed was the Aeroscraft's oversized cargo bay, which has greater dimensions than the largest cargo carrying aircraft on the market today. Furthermore, because the cargo is loaded and off-loaded from the bottom of the aircraft, it is not limited to traditional nose-loading size restrictions.\nAt the end of the meeting, members agreed to host follow-up assemblies to further explore how the Aeroscraft could be integrated into European logistics supply chains.\nAeros expects the first Aeroscraft to be ready for operation in the next two to three years.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T16:52:04Z", "url": "http://www.heavyliftpfi.com/sectors/aeroscraft-discussed-at-european-parliament/", "byte_size": 1700, "char_size": 1700}

For every pound spent by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust to fund a VIA, an additional four pound has been leveraged from an external agency.\nThe VIA programme is structured as a competitive leverage funding programme, whereby funds will only be awarded following success of an application to an external funding body. External funding bodies include government funding bodies, academic institutions and other medical research charities where applications undergo peer review.\nWe agree VIA funding in principle prior to submission of external funding body applications. Please contact us well in advance of your submission in order for us to consider your application so we can add a letter of support.\nThe VIA programme relies on the science being peer reviewed by the external funding body, thus we can only consider applications where this peer review will take place. For industry awards we request evidence of internal review prior to awarding funding, please contact us for the process.\nIf you wish to apply for a VIA, please contact us researchgrants@cysticfibrosis.org.uk.\nSince we started funding these awards in 2013 we have awarded over 50 grants across a range of different research areas. Descriptions of the types of research we\u2019re funding are listed below, where you can find out more about ongoing projects in the research areas that interest you.\nYou can also see who we have partnered with in each VIA, using our colour-coded labels for: NIHR partner, Charity Partner, Pharmaceutical Partner, Academic Partner, Government Agency Partner and Registry Study\u200b.\nThe timing of lung exacerbations or a worsening of CF symptoms can be very hard to predict. We\u2019re currently funding studies in children and adults to understand more about them. If we can predict when they might happen, then we can treat them quicker and ultimately aim to make them happen less often.\nFind out more about research into lung exacerbations here.\nWhile the symptoms of CF are well known, better ways to manage them are continually being developed, helping to keep people healthier and reducing their effects on quality of life. Our research projects range from ensuring that the way lung function is measured is as accurate as possible, to developing drugs that can help break down the mucus in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis.\nFind out more about research into managing symptoms here.\nPeople with CF can have a range of different lung infections, and it\u2019s important to know which infections are present and how to treat them. Understanding how bacteria work can lead researchers to spot weaknesses that can be targeted with drugs. The research we\u2019re currently funding includes learning more about the bacteria to identify their weak spots, discovering how to disrupt the formation of \u2018biofilms\u2019 that cause antibiotic resistance and developing methods to speed up the detection of bacteria in samples from people with cystic fibrosis.\nFind out more about research into understanding and treating infections here.\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic condition, caused by damage to the \u2018CFTR\u2019 gene in both copies of the gene. The location of damage within the genes can vary from person to person \u2013 this is what is known as a \u201cgenotype\u201d.

{"text": "Sandy Smith woke up to the annoying and familiar sound of the alarm clock. It was another day and the beginning of another hectic week. She rolled from her stomach onto her back and unburied herself from beneath the old, down-filled, pillows. Sandy reached over and pressed the snooze button in an attempt to steal five more minutes of peace. As Sandy stretched, she felt the pain, a stiff ache that had unfortunately loomed over her body every morning for quite some time.\nOnce out of bed, Sandy leaned over and tried to concentrate on making the perfect hospital corners. She slightly lifted the large, squishy mattress, and tucked the corners just right, trying to ignore her stiff muscles and joints. She shuffled into the bathroom and brought her toothbrush to her mouth. Hunched over the sink, trying to avoid the tired reflection staring back at her, Sandy brushed her teeth. Her motions were slow this morning, and she had no time to concern herself with a little pain.\n\"Here they come,\" Sandy thought to herself as she heard the pitter-patter of four little feet running down the hallway. The kids were awake, eager to begin the day. Sandy threw on a skirt and sweater, pulling her brown high heels out from the back of the closet.\n\"Ow,\" Sandy exclaimed. The pain in her back sent a sharp signal to her brain that the day was not going to run smoothly. She clomped down the hall to retrieve the hairbrush stuck in her daughter's long hair, and her feet found Barbie. Her heels had little traction and she grabbed the banister for support.\nRealizing she was late, Sandy bent over to scoop up her 2-year-old. Her back seemed to yell at her, and she suddenly realized her toddler was becoming heavier every day.\nAfter cereal and burnt toast, Sandy marched her girls to the bus stop and waved good-bye as she turned toward her car, angry with herself for sleeping those five extra minutes. She would have to face Monday morning gridlock and suddenly felt the beginning of a headache that would stay with her all day.\n\"I love Mondays,\" Sandy said to herself as she sat in traffic. She reached for her cell phone, cradling it between her neck and head. Her conference call would need to be conducted in the car, and her headache only worsened.\nThirty minutes later, Sandy pulled into her parking place. She sprang from her car, heaved her over-stuffed leather bag over her shoulder, and scurried through the office doors.\nSandy's Monday morning was filled with telephone calls and last minute deadlines. She tried to type and talk at the same time, constantly crossing and re-crossing the left leg over the right. She began breathing erratically when she realized her deadline would not be met. The lunch hour was approaching, and it suddenly occurred to Sandy that she had not taken a break all morning. Her computer screen appeared blurry and her wrists were stiff.\nThe remainder of Sandy's day was much of the same, and she could not wait to take off her shoes. After skipping lunch and sitting through meetings, Sandy drug herself to her car, threw her bag in the back seat and started the stressful trek home. That night, after the kids devoured dinner, Sandy longed for a long hot shower. The girls were in the bathtub, and she winced as she reached over to carefully lift her toddler onto the floor. By this time, her neck and joints screamed in pain and Sandy wanted nothing more than to climb into bed.\nIt was eleven at night and Sandy was finally lying down. Her bed and pillows did not seem comfortable, and she felt for only an instant that her neck needed a little more support. She drifted off to sleep out of sheer exhaustion.\nDoes Sandy remind you of anyone? The more stressful our lives become, the less we focus on the \"moment.\" When we aren't conscious of how we sleep, breathe, stand, lift, bend or sit, our bodies can take a beating that results in lingering pain. We often avoid the early signs of discomfort we feel in our back, shoulders or neck until we are unable to ignore the pain. By reading the tips below, you can learn to make even the busiest days pain free.\nWhen you wake in the morning, start the day with a couple of stretches. Stand up and stretch your arms above your head. Do the \"hug your best friend.\" Wrap your arms around your body, and turn as far as you can to the left, then to the right.\nWhen performing everyday routines such as brushing your teeth, remember your posture. Do not hunch over the sink; stand up straight.\nDon't bend from the waist when you lift a child. Squat with your back straight. Keep the child close to you and use your arms and legs to lift.\nHold the telephone with your hand or use the speakerphone. Cradling the phone between your head and shoulder can lock up the spinal joints in the neck and upper back, eventually causing pain.\nWhile in the office, make sure your chair fits correctly. There should be two inches between the front edge of your seat and the back of your knees. The chair should tilt back so you are able to rest while reading from a computer screen.\nMany people suffer from tension headaches. Adequate lighting and document holders by your computer can help reduce the risk of a headache. Materials placed on a desk cause you to constantly raise and lower your neck while you're typing at your keyboard.\nDo not wear high heels. The weight of the foot is not evenly distributed, which not only causes sore feet, but also added spinal stress.\nDo not carry a heavy bag with its strap over your shoulder, unless you place the strap over your head on the side opposite the bag. Wearing a shoulder strap over one shoulder unevenly places the weight of the bag on one side of the body, potentially causing shoulder and back pain. Or better yet, carry a bag with a handle rather than a strap.\nDo not consistently cross the same knee over the other. This habit can eventually cause misalignment of the spine.\nEven if you remain sitting for the majority of your workday, you deserve a break. Get up from your desk and move around, stretching arms and legs as much as possible to avoid postural and spinal stress. Try to practice deep and even breathing to keep yourself calm and keep adequate oxygen flowing through your system.\nBath time can be fun for the kids but stressful on any parent. Make certain to bend from the waist and not the back when bathing your children. Use your legs when you lift your child.\nIt is important to get a good night's rest. Choose a comfortable mattress and pillow that adequately support the weight of your head and body.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T14:29:18Z", "url": "https://www.southmainchiro.com/articles/general/418246-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-working-mom", "byte_size": 6540, "char_size": 6540}

Liegner, M.D.\nFollowing completion of his medical training and a one-year stint as attending physician on Howard Champion's Surgical Critical Care Service and MedStar Unit at Washington Hospital Center in the District of Columbia, Kenneth Liegner, M.D. returned to Westchester County, home of his Alma Mater, New York Medical College, to start a private practice. Unwittingly, he had 'plunked himself down' in the heart of a burgeoning epidemic of Lyme disease. His patients confronted him with puzzling syndromes that defied 'tidy' formulations of the illness and thrust him in to a Maelstrom of medical controversy.\nLyme disease, a new poorly understood disease, emerged hand in hand with the rise 'managed care'. Physicians caring for persons with Lyme disease, loyal to the Hippocratic Oath and serving what they saw as patients' best medical interests, found themselves on a collision course with a new Corporate Medical Ethic dedicated to maximizing profit.\nOne practitioner's work over 25 years is presented here along with correspondence with many principals in the field. Documentational in nature and not written as a narrative, the materials, nonetheless, convey the intensity of the struggle to characterize the nature of Lyme disease and the desperate fight for proper diagnosis and treatment upon the outcome of which patients' very lives depended. The volume includes protocols useful as reference materials for patients and practitioners alike, as well as photographic images of many persons important in the history of Lyme disease.\nForeword by Pam Weintraub, Senior Editor of aeon digital magazine and author of award-winning book Cure Unknown: Inside the Lyme Epidemic.\nPreface by Paul W.

{"text": "How do you know you're not just making karma worse??\nThe answer to the question in the OP is given in the first two verses of the Dharmapada.\nBut dependent origination, when reduced to its essential components, simply means: where there is affliction, there is a cause for action; where there is action there is a cause for suffering; and where there is suffering, there is a condition for further affliction. Without affliction, there is no cause for action; without action, there is no result, suffering.\nA Buddhas deeds are not based on afflcition (desire, hatred, and ignorance); they are based on wisdom. Hence, they do not result in suffering.\nA buddha's mind stream is conditioned and relative; it is however free of affliction and endowed with omniscience.\nDzogchen mainly describes how samsara begins (with an aim to reverse it), but the \u201cmechanics\u201d of samsara are the same: affliction\u2014> action \u2014> suffering \u2014>affliction as infinitum unless one breaks the chain at affliction.\nAn action always has a result. An affliction does not need to have a result.\nWhat is the definition (in the context of Dharma) of an affliction?\nWhat is the definition (in the context for Dharma) of an action?\nPer the mechanism illustrated in the sequence above, WHY is it that affliction does not need to have a result?\nA painful mental state, i.e., desire, hatred, and ignorance, or anything that is conducive to a painful mental state, i.e., impure conditioned phenomena.\nVolition is action, this produces verbal and physical acts.\nAfflictions do not necessarily produce volitions. When we are aware of our afflictive state, we can disengage our minds from actions related towards afflictive objects. This is why we practice \u015bamatha, actually, so that we are aware of our mind's afflictive state. Being aware of our mind's afflictive state is called mindfulness and attention. Being unaware of our mind's afflictive stated is called being mindless and inattentive.\nWhat we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present thoughts build the life of tomorrow: our life is the creation of our mind.\nIf one speaks or acts with an impure mind, suffering follows as the wheel of the cart follows the beast that draws the cart.\nIf a person speaks or acts with a pure mind, joy follows as her own shadow.\nI think this is where faith enters the picture, is it not? \"How can I be sure I'm acting from pure motives?\" The answer is: you can only do your best. That's where trust of your true nature and in the dharma comes into play. We can't understand all the depths and complexities in our current state, hence, the need for the teaching in the first place! That is why it is compared to a raft. And we need to have faith in it.\nWhat are the post signs along the road I should be paying attention to?\nGood intention is so important but perhaps not enough and sometimes even triggering. Even someone wishes so very much to help, the help can be seen as an attack. Just like a wolf painfully entangled in a trap, will bite when a hand is sticking out to help him out of that desperate situation. He would bite, as we would, to each other and perhaps even to Enlightened help.\nTrapped in duality, I think your advice is a great recommendation to be less a slave of the dividing mind.\nAs long as dualism is present, there is continuation of karma.\nThat's why the relation to the teacher is so important. Because you need that faith until you see for yourself.\nI am fully accepting that I don't see into the functionalities of cause and condition.\nThe more I practise the more firm beliefs transform into mere possibilities.\nWe talk about karma in principle, and I am fixed (determined) on understanding it in its correct view. But not to just understand and talk about it. I want this to be done already. I'm fed up with being ignorant. It is very clear to me once I entered this practice how incredibly multifaceted every relative situation is even in ONE family for each individual.. and grasping just how many conditions contribute to stimulate habituated patterns that manifest like from \"many a fiction story for every episode of one's life,\" yet seeing them line up, tracking the trends, hindsight helps in defining and illustrating very clearly what is priority and what isn't... I fully trust the self-perfecting process precisely because the connection proves I prioritized my connection to the teachings before, in this being inhabited by a conventional me, and wh knows how many other Me's before. It sometimes feel like the anchor was to be born where my teacher was in the years he was there (not many Tibetans in Naples) but I had a specific situation which was quite awful for many years. It was slaking off debts one by one to get to a position where the practice can really begin, one insanity after the other and many of those afflictions did exhaust themselves and no longer bind my current conditions... But some DO! Yet somehow I'm not that attached to their story anymore, I see them for their worth and only feel a kind of gratitude my conditions provided me with the correct medicine to feel the transparency of things... As if becoming more relative in my understanding in which even more precision is called for!\nOgyen, you haven't responded to a question on the first page: which vehicle does your post refer to?\nI read so much pondering in the long posts you write. I see your longing for logic, precision which you think to attain through determination. And I think (and that is the dzogchen view) that this is not how it is going to work. Let go and rest in what is there right now. Now remembering, no expectation.\nMake the seeing of the true nature of your mind your one and only goal.\nTrying to verify your karma is just another play of the ego's mind. Of course it may be fun going down that road, but stay in awareness of its inherent emptiness.\nThis is where the true journey starts.\nKarma is a difficult one to figure out.\nFor example: My brother died earlier this year and left a heap of debts that my family and I have to pay for.\nThis lead me to wondering: How can I know if this is due to old debts which were accrued by me towards him that I now have to pay for, OR are these new debts being accrued by him towards me?\nOnly a Buddha can know.\nSorry to hear about your brother, Grigoris.\nYour post got me thinking about collective karma though. What role does it play, if any, in a situation like this? Is that even how collective karma works? How much of our suffering is due to our own karmic debts? At what point can we say that suffering is not just the result of individual karmic debts? Is it when an entire country is devastated by some natural disaster or when an entire group of people is persecuted and killed? Does collective karma operate on a smaller scale - like between a group of co-workers or a family unit?\nI understand that there is a danger with this line of thinking, especially for someone like me, where collective karma can be a means to externalising all of my suffering and causes of suffering. But can this be notion be totally ignored when looking at suffering in its entirety?\nI'm probably not articulating this well due to incompetence. Apologies for the noob post.\nAt what point can we say that suffering is not just the result of individual karmic debts?\nThis is a very interesting question, which is going beyond my poor limitations. Instead of being able to provide an answer, other questions are popping up only: if all karmic debts would be purely individual, would there than not be a subtle belief in an \"individual, a person, a one on itself\"? Is not all dependent, even so subtle what our intellect cannot get?\nI do not reject when we are acting unwholesome or wholesome, from these, our own harvest will be coloured. Would that only be, without any influence on all around us? Then how would it be called wholesome and unwholesome? Personal only?\nI do not reject we must awaken ourselves, none can do it for us, (even we are temporary dependent on 'some navigation medicines' to help) But if it is solely individual ' karmic harvest', we must be energies on our own. Perhaps with a stony separating wall around body-speech and mind.\nps My warm support to Greece, for the whole family.\nHi, apologies.. life ate up a lot of time lately. Just seeing this. Karma applies to all vehicles. It is not even philosophy specific. It is a principle which encompasses all vehicles and beings that stumbled into Samsara.\nIt's nicely thought out thank you for taking the time to write. I may go on and on in my posts... I guarantee I'm not a terribly lengthy thinker off the boards, I just have general existential angst I'm working out overall, as I find myself in that awkward phase between birth and death.\nI had a wonderful retreat recently which opened my eyes a great deal, and I have a strong confidence in the method of Dharma. I study all aspects of buddhadharma but due to karmic conditions and previous aspirations, I really resonate most with the Dzogchen vehicle.\nVerifying karma is a fundamental part of understanding the true nature of your actual condition, I don't think it's an ego game. To see the true nature of your mind there's a lot of layers to get thru... I mean we are caked in conditioning that prevents us from really integrating our own true nature, so much of this is a very useful exercise.\nThe question mostly pertained to finding markers and knowing that you are going the right way (for you). We think a lot of things. That doesn't mean we see or understand what the conditions are which are producing that thinking/feeling and acting. I have now learned how to verify that and apply it.\nAll of a sudden... Karmic conditions are maturing rather quickly manifesting in the form of obstacles and changes which I sometimes can mitigate somewhat thru the effect of secondary causes generated by the protection of practice. The rest I deal with as I can.\nI've also had that question pop up in some situations and I've come to think that maybe not even a personal thing between you and your brother... More like a series of conditions you both had accumulated at some point that now matured this way, you with having a kind of load to carry that is debt related, and he to leaving your family in this specific secanrio.. and now you're where this karma will run its course... The trick is to either just exhaust that karma trying to have better clarity of the nature of these relative (but very annoyingly felt) consequences, and to not generate new karma in body speech and mind. Of course it's much easier said than done... But I have been taking to welcoming exhausting karma as needed, and I've started to become sensitive to how every action and thought produces it's own kind of karma.\nMany good hugs and vibes to you.\nHow do you know you're not just making things worse thinking you're making things better (good intentions and all that jazz)???\nThe solution is always to practice what you've been given until your mind becomes clear, meaning unhelpful states of mind have subsided & you can act based on wisdom. If you're unsure, practice more.\nIf practicing doesn't seem like enough, you have two options... one is to accumulate more karma and wait for it to burn itself out through your experiences, and the other is to practice anyway. Mechanically they are identical, but functionally they are opposed. Blindly creating karma through mundane activity is the risky one. Practice necessarily protects you from that, always, every single time, because it's not connected to your ordinary mind, but to your wisdom mind, which is the very mind of the Buddha.\nMore to the point, in which direction is your fear (i.e., of worsening karma) pushing you?\nIs it constructive or not?\nHow much time do you spend with this fear by itself, vs. letting it spur you to action? The state of your mind, which is capable of indulging the fear in unproductive/harmful ways, is what creates the karma producing the fear you mean to escape.\nIf the fear is there and you can't get rid of it at this time (because you can't change the conditions causing it to arise), employ practice. Let go of the mind that judges & tries to ascertain what will happen, because this is based on the Eight Worldly Attitudes; seize the mind that is committed to making your life meaningful through practice.\nIt already exists within you, ready to be activated through conscious contemplation. Remember that the practice you've done in the past & that you choose to do currently is helping you right now, as opposed to in the future.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T06:39:34Z", "url": "https://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?t=28391&start=40", "byte_size": 12601, "char_size": 12590}

If you have the money saved already, this article is not for you.\nYou try to save the amount or borrow it from someone else or borrow it from your own retirement fund.\nThe first step is to absolutely work the numbers and figure out your budget. While this is not an actual savings tactic, it\u2019s a crucial step in the process because it gives you a concrete goal to work towards.\nKnowing this number makes it a real goal and clears up the confusion and vagueness of having some idea of some large dollar amount, that\u2019s probably unattainable anyway. Remember, half the battle is gaining mental clarity and setting the goal.\nRemember, half the battle is gaining mental clarity and setting the goal.\nStep 2 \u2013 Then use a home-buying calculator to plug in your numbers, and it will give you a better sense of how big of a home you can afford.\nZillow\u2019s mortgage calculator is pretty helpful in helping you find this number.\nStep 3 \u2013 To know how your potential creditors think you\u2019re capable of handling, get pre-qualified. Do not look for a $500,000 home if you are pre-qualified for only $300,000. This is a reality-check step.\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say we did our budgeting and used the calculator to figure out that you can afford and qualified for a $500,000 home, so your down payment savings goal should be $100,000.\nNow consider these tips to save up.\nNow you can start to plan how much money you should really put aside each month.\nYou\u2019ll also get a better idea of how long it will take to reach your goal. If you\u2019re on the five-year plan, that means you\u2019ll need to save an extra $20,000 a year.\nDon\u2019t panic, just break it down further. An extra $20,000 a year is about $1,700 a month, which sounds way less intimidating.\nKeep in mind you\u2019ll still need to continue saving for your emergency fund, IRA, and paying down debt.\nYou\u2019ve heard this from me again and again: get a side gig, make extra money, work overtime, increase your income!\nIt sounds like generic advice but there\u2019s a reason why experts dish out the same advice: it\u2019s because earning extra money is a lot easier than drastically changing your lifestyle to scrimp and save.\nGoing this route is just not realistic or sustainable. Pinching pennies is not going to get you closer to the $1,700 each month, but increasing your income will.\nThis is going to take research on your part, but it\u2019ll be worth it \u2014 just imagine how you will enjoy your dream house, and what the extra income will afford you.\nThe best way to start is to make a list of what you\u2019re good at, and if you can leverage and outsource those skills during your free time to make that $1,700.\nOne of the items that your mortgage lender will look at is your overall DTI (debt-to-income) ratio.\nIf you\u2019re carrying a lot of credit card debt, you might want to look into a personal loan to consolidate and lower your payment. Debt consolidation loans can help you have a single monthly payment at a fixed rate.\nNot only does this help you eliminate debt faster, but it can help increase your credit score by up to 40 points according to Payoff.\nIf you\u2019re able to reduce your monthly payment and increase your score, you\u2019ll be in great shape to qualify for a mortgage.\nAfter you establish that, any kind of extra money that comes in during the year goes straight into that fund.\nThis includes any bonus from your employer, tax refunds, Christmas bonuses, gifts, inheritances, lottery, gambling win, etc.\nA 20 percent savings goal may be discouraging, especially if you have zero saved, but it can be done \u2014 all you need is a concrete plan and a savings mentality.\nThese methods are tried by people I know.\nTry to find alternative areas where housing is cheaper and your present savings allow for you to buy a home there, instead of the dream location you previously thought about.\nIf you have valuable property elsewhere then sell it to arrange for mortgage down payment. This includes inherited valuables, foreign real estate, etc.\nPutoff savings in your retirement fund for a couple of years. Redirect this fund to your home buying fund.\nIf all else fails, then go for mortgage insurance by paying only a small % of the loan, typically 5% only. But, be prepared to spend extra $100-$300 per month on mortgage insurance. You can start repaying the loan faster and as soon as cross the 20% ownership criteria, opt out of that insurance.\nStart with determining how much down payment is required for your need, your credit and home location. Then divide the number by the months you\u2019re willing to wait. Once you have the monthly savings goal, start by aggressively saving that amount from your monthly budget or increase side income.\nYou can also bring in additional money from selling some of your valuable stuff to reach your goal early. You can also consider lowering your goal by opting for a smaller home, different location. If you fail in your goal, down pay a lesser amount and opt for mortgage insurance.\nReaders, let us know how you saved for mortgage down payment.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T22:10:06Z", "url": "http://onecentatatime.com/tips-to-save-money-for-mortgage-down-payment/", "byte_size": 5218, "char_size": 5170}
{"text": "Cyrsti's Condo: The Right or Wrong Person for the Job?\nThe Right or Wrong Person for the Job?\nI really don't know how many times I have sworn myself off the \"allure\" or lack of it from Caitlin Jenner.\nOf course I know the non negotiables. Without a doubt she is the biggest public relation's splash ever in the transgender community. Now we have a former Olympic hero along with Navy Seal Kristin Beck as recent \"coming out\" stories. In fact, Kristin is running for US Congress.\nI am sure Jenner's life will ever allow her to ever experience the everyday lives we live as transgender women. Can you imagine the paparazzi crowding into a women's restroom with her?\nAfter watching her last show rater intently (and knowing it's a glossy over produced Kartrashian show) I couldn't see the emotion in Jenner. Again, I don't know all the facts about her, except she went out and bought the best plastic surgery money could buy. Again, maybe that's why I can't see any emotion in her face-she can't move it!!!!\nPlus, I have no idea how long she has been back on HRT. It took me three years on hormones to begin to see the world in a different way. When I watch Jenner, I wonder if she has passed over (no pun intended) to the feminine side much at all. She tries to overtalk most people and doesn't want to listen for the real problems-typical male.\nThen again, maybe I am just watching the true quandary of a Mtf gender transition play out with Jenner.

{"text": "WordPress has long provided inline documentation throughout the administrative interface that provide explanations for various features and input fields. This includes an explanations of excerpts, trackbacks, custom fields, page parents, etc. These are great for newcomers to WordPress, but for those with sufficient familiarity these bits of text are no longer necessary and merely provide visual noise. This plugin gets rid of those descriptive texts.\nThe plugin\u2019s behavior is made available as a per-user profile option.

In a few cases, descriptive text is left intact when it is of enough importance to warrant retention, or the markup structure does not facilitate easy removal.\nThe plugin is further customizable via two filters. Code using these filters should ideally be put into a mu-plugin or site-specific plugin (which is beyond the scope of this readme to explain). Less ideally, you could put them in your active theme\u2019s functions.php file.\nThe \u2018c2c_admin_expert_mode\u2019 filter allows you to dynamically determine whether the admin expert mode should be active.\nThe \u2018c2c_admin_expert_mode_default\u2019 filter allows you to specify whether admin expert mode should be active for users by default or not. This filter only applies to users who visit the admin for the first time after the plugin is activated. Once a user visits the admin, their setting gets set to the default state and will no longer be affected by this filter. If you wish to affect the setting for existing users, use the \u2018c2c_admin_expert_mode\u2019 filter instead.\nA screenshot of some of the panels of the 'Edit Post' admin page after this plugin is activated.\nA screenshot of the same panels of the 'Edit Post' admin page as they appear in a standard WP 3.3 installation.

Use the \u2018disable-admin-expert-mode\u2019 query parameter with a value of \u20181\u2019 to disable admin expert mode for the loaded page. This would yield a URL, for example, of https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?disable-admin-expert-mode=1.

Here are some ideas from last week's party that might come in handy!\nFrom Hazel and Gold Designs , this gorgeous inlaid wood Christmas tree tray!

Love this vignette!\nHow much fun are these Edible Candles from All That's Jas? Would make a great centerpiece that you get to eat as dessert!\nPrintables make seasonal decor so simple. This one from My Busy Beehives is ready to print and frame!\nI will start decking my halls this coming weekend and wanted to add some new items to my Christmas decor. This sign was easy to make starting with a ready to decorate sign I found at Michaels 70% off!\nImages / Phrase to cut. The ornaments and \"BELIEVE\" phrase were in my library, previously purchased from the Silhouette online store.\nSize and cut your images and text. I used the \"BELIEVE\" and ornament images I got from the Silhouette online store. For the rest of the sentiment, I just chose fonts from my library.\nThe ornament image is designed with the snowflakes to be cut separately and layered. I wanted to change that up so I un-grouped everything and then put the snowflakes inside the ornament.\nOnce you have your images cut out, then take a deep breath, have a Harry Potter marathon on in the background, and \"proceed to weed\" your vinyl. Once that's done then apply the transfer tape and prepare to apply to your sign.\nI applied the \"BELIEVE\" vinyl first, then the rest of my phrase and finally the ornaments. It has a vintage / farmhouse feel to it!\nFrom our home to yours, wishing you a very Happy Thanksgiving filled with family, friends, food, and lots of love and laughs.\nHi all and welcome to another week's fun of sharing creativity. Can you believe this time next week all the hours of cooking and prepping and depending on where you are maybe eating will be over? One week to Thanksgiving! If you're still getting ready to host, here are some ideas to inspire you.\nHere's a lovely tablescape from The Handmade Home. Love the Moscow Mule mugs and the centerpiece basket filled with white gourds and candles! Head on over because she's also got some free downloadable place cards!\nYou still have time to add a Fall themed pillow. I especially love the non-traditional color of this one from Kathleen at Our Hopeful Home.\nIf you're in a place where weather permits hosting an outdoor dinner, check out this gorgeously rustic Boho Chic idea from Birds Party.\nFinally, from Carol at The Red Painted Cottage comes this gorgeous thick wood tray complete with a tutorial ( bottom of post) so you can make your own or maybe one to give as a holiday gift!\nThe first thing I'll say is, if you've wanted to try heat transfer vinyl and been intimidated so keep putting it off because you think it's too complicated ....DON'T. Because that was me, I used it for the first time and was kicking myself saying \"Why didn't I do this sooner?\"\nThere's no logic behind why I thought that, just did. But I finally decided to go for it and it's a game changer. I decided to start with something simple: a pillow. I also decided to go w/ a design that didn't matter if I messed up the mirroring because I kept reading how key that is to using HTV.\nI'm not going to describe pillow construction. My sewing skills extend to four straight lines.\nThe front side goes down. When you put your vinyl on your cutting mat, you're cutting from the underside of the vinyl. It took me one attempt to figure this out. HTV comes with a clear plastic liner, its own transfer tape in a way which is the side you want to touch your cutting mat.\nSee how the matte side is \"up\"? That's what you want. The shiny side is what will go on your project and this is a shot during the weeding process. About that. I HATE WEEDING. If you're not a vinyl user, weeding is removing the parts of the vinyl you don't need to reveal the image. This stuff just pulled away so easily!\nThis is a (bad) picture of the front / shiny side that will go on your project. Once your project is weeded, it's already on the equivalent of the transfer tape so it's super easy to lay down on your material.\nThe heat process is more press than iron.\nWhen applying your iron, it's more of a press and pick up than slide your iron around. Press, hold, pick up, move to next session. Now, I did do some slight gliding but the main process is press and lift. This is why you'll see serious HTV people use a heat press which is like a vinyl panini maker.\nYou will use a pressing cloth on top of the plastic carrier sheet when applying heat. This is good. What's not good is deciding to use said cloth directly on top of the vinyl when you're just trying to make extra sure that you've applied enough heat. This will result in the weave of your pressing cloth ( mine was a scrap of a flour sack towel) transferring to your vinyl. Now as it turned out this was OK w/ my project because the texture looked kinda cool but in general, if you don't want this, keep the plastic from the vinyl between the surface of your project and your pressing cloth!\nOnce my image was applied, I went about construction my pillow. And voila!\nIf you're using words or letters, you will need to \"mirror\" (flip) your project before you cut it or your letters will be backwards when you apply. I chose this image because it didn't matter if I messed that up since it was the same either way. As it turned out, the Cameo 3 asks you if you want to do this because you will have selected the HTV material in your cut settings.\nIf you're not using a full sheet of vinyl, you need to pay attention to which side of the mat you put your vinyl on, again because of the mirroring. So if you place a smaller than 12x12 piece on your mat on the left side, choose mirror, the Cameo at any rate will actually cut from the right side of your mat so put your vinyl on the right side of the mat!\nI'm happy with my first attempt and have a new addition to my Thanksgiving decor.\nSide Table. Found these pumpkin signs last year 90% off after Halloween. Painted and applied glitter vinyl. Turkeys were 75% off at JoAnn one year. Painted w/ glitter paint.\nMarc Roberts Harvest Fairy. I have a collection of Christmas fairies but found this Fall themed one on sale one year.\nAs much as I dislike eating anything pumpkin, I love making pumpkin projects. Go figure! I thought I'd round up some of my favorite pumpkin transformations.\nI did these for Halloween but can work for Thanksgiving / Fall. Faux pumpkin, silk leaves, rolled paper roses and a drawer pull.\nMore tissue paper and Mod Podge.\nDrop cloth, fabric and leather scraps.\nI hope you're all enjoying this Saturday, doing whatever fills your soul. This week's party continues here.\nI saw this quote somewhere online as I was hopping around and don't remember where but it resonated with me so I decided to make a printable.\nIt's sized 8x10 so click on whichever image to bring to full resolution. Graphics are from a Rustic Wreath collection I downloaded from Creative Market.\nHappy Friday Eve all and welcome to another party. Hope you've all had a great week.\nI'm pleased to announce the winner of my recent Paperless Post giveaway ( winner was randomly selected via Rafflecopter) is Kim who has been notified via email. Thanks to everyone who participated.\nOK who else has never heard of an \"Ears and Beers\" party (as the name implies, it involves corn and beer)? I love hosting this party because I learn new things all the time. Jenny from Jenny Louise Marie shared how she hosted one of these and you really need to check it out to see all the amazing things she did and incporated popcorn, candy corn, corn tortilla chips, Mexican street corn, candy corn jello shots and of course, beer!\nShe sent her guests home with these corn themed favors that could easily work for Thanksgiving.\nMy son is coming home for Thanksgiving so I must have beer on my mind since he is a craft beer aficionado. I know not everyone drinks beer so you could easily do this w/ your beverage of choice , but Milena and Chris from Craftbeering came up with a fun way to count down until Christmas especially since there are many seasonal brews that are only out a certain times of the year.\nYou could even have a different flavor for each day!\nTis the season to be wreathy and Cathy from Vintage Paint and More has got you covered.\nFinally, if you are looking for pie alternatives for Thanksgiving or for any time, check out this gorgeous Apple Galette from Mrs. Kringles Kitchen!\nOK now on to this week's party!", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T05:03:05Z", "url": "http://www.answerischoco.com/2017/11/", "byte_size": 8715, "char_size": 8715}

{"text": "It is difficult to predict the future. What is going to happen in the stock market? Will my property value continue to increase? Will I be able to afford to send my children to college? The current stable economy will not last forever.\nNo one knows what the future holds but I do know that those organizations that have the best leadership will be positioned to be the most competitive, the most desirable to work at and the most likely to prosper in any economic climate.\nWhen a leader freaks out and starts changing things their people are intensely affected. Inconsistent leadership creates an environment that is full of distractions for the people they lead. When the people are distracted they cannot focus on the purpose, mission and tasks at hand for the enterprise.\nIt will always come back to what you believe. What do you believe about keeping your commitments? What do you believe about your people? What do you believe about what is in your control? What do you believe about the values that you say you have and make decisions by?\nIt is common to want to change, cut, reorganize and eliminate during uncertain times. In uncertain times the foundation of great leadership is staying steady. The key is to understand where and what to stay steady with.\nIt is your values that keep you steady. Your values detail what you believe about who you are as an organization, how you see your people, what you believe your commitment to the community is and what excellence looks like in your organization.\nPeople do not realize how quickly they are moved by external pressure. They are quick to change what they do. They don\u2019t stay steady with their values. They may not even give their values a thought. If they have a great set of values the values will serve them in good and difficult times \u2013 that\u2019s part of the test of a great set of values. The values are your rock. They are your foundation.\nHow you see your people is critical. The people you lead know if you believe in them or resent them. They know if you trust them or fear them. And, they know if you see them as important or inessential to your success.\nWhen you believe that your people create solutions to the challenges you face, you treat them differently than if you see them as the cause of those problems. This critical belief about the people you work with will shape every decision you make and your effectiveness as a powerful leader.\nTruly great leaders also have a complete understanding of four areas of control. They understand what they can control. They understand what they cannot control. They understand what they should not try and control. And, they understand when something is out of control.\nWhen you focus on what you cannot control, weak economic conditions and soft markets, then you start making excuses for underperformance. When you understand what is truly in your control, you naturally focus on those areas and create solutions to challenges and lead your people in a more powerful way.\nIf you, as the leader, are freaking out over things that are out of your control then your people will also. If you, as the leader, are steady, calm and focused on what you can control then so are the people you lead. In challenging times, as in any times, calm and focused always wins out.\nAccountability is first and foremost about people. So is leadership. Accountability is not something you do by yourself. Nor is it something you ask of your people, if you as the leader are not living it yourself. That is never going to work.\nWhen you keep your commitments to your people, when you are an accountable leader, your people respond differently. They focus, they are productive and they seek both your success and the success of the organization.\nAccountability is never about taking the easy way out. There is no quick fix. Accountability is labor intensive. Time is a friend to accountability. Accountability is an investment you make in your people and in your organization for the long haul. Accountability is there when times are good and anyone can prosper. It is there when times are tough when only some prosper.\nWe live in the present. The past is gone. There is only now. How we lead now, today, will determine the future of our relationships, our organizations and the results we achieve.\nAccountability is the future of leadership. Those organizations, in the future, that focus on accountability will always have the best people, the most committed people and achieve the greatest results.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T11:44:15Z", "url": "https://samsilverstein.com/the-future-of-leadership-is-accountability/", "byte_size": 4500, "char_size": 4494}

There are actually several approaches to prevent as well as cease loss of hair. The adhering to post is going to deliver you some practical suggestions to accomplish simply that!\nIf you are concerned regarding loss of hair attempt lime seeds as well as black pepper. To begin with, obtain equal volumes of both lime seeds and also dark pepper after that grind all of them up. Next, blend them with water. At that point you can administer this mix to your scalp.

{"text": "How do you define crazy? Crazy means deranged. Deranged means insane. Insane means crazy. It\u2019s an ouroborus. But deep down, we all know crazy when we see it or hear it because there\u2019s something universal about expectations of thinking and behavior that transcends description.\nIn my effort to use this blog as a means of teaching how to develop skills of interpreting literature, today we have an amazing opportunity to learn about characterization at the hands of a master storyteller, Christopher Nolan.\nInformation/description given by the narrator without any judgment- ex. The narrator of a story tells you, \u201cJohn was a tall man.\u201d It\u2019s descriptive, but there\u2019s no implication or judgment involved.\nIn literature, all of these are easily accessible. In film, however, Numbers 1 & 2 only apply when there\u2019s a Voice-Over Narration. So I\u2019ll be focusing this analysis of The Dark Knight on numbers 3,4,5. Number six is accessible in the film only through voice over.\nHere we go. It starts with a claim. After you make a claim, the next thing you have to do is look for examples in the text (this case Nolan\u2019s film) to support your claim. Those examples are called Textual Evidence. That\u2019s right-evidence \u2013 information gathered to support a conclusion.\nCLAIM: Actor Heath Ledger said of the character The Joker that he played in the film The Dark Knight, that The Joker was \u201ca psychotic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy\u201d who merely wants to \u201cupset the social order through crime.\u201d However, if one looks at the definition of these clinical terms, one sees that throughout the film The Joker displays clear attributes of the opposite. It\u2019s the Hamlet question \u2013 Is he insane or merely pretending to be?\nLedger\u2019s performance is a tour de force, a fine line that balances completely on characterization. Ledger claims the Joker is a psychotic. A clinical definition deems psychosis to be characterized by changes in personality, impaired functioning, or a nonexistent sense of objective reality. Let\u2019s take these one by one.\nFrom our first encounter with The Joker, we see that he is consistent. He is revealed as the master mind behind a bank robbery in progress and through his manipulation of his henchmen and by playing them for their greediness, he manages to be the only one leaving with the money. He is pretending in this scene to be merely another lackey on the heist, this establishes pretense as a tool in his behavioral arsenal. While his actions seem erratic or capricious, we see evidence of advanced planning every step of the way. In the scene where he introduces his plan to get rid of Batman to a gathering of Gotham City\u2019s mob bosses, he is threatened. When this happens, he opens his coat revealing live grenades one can only assume he is more than willing to use. His use of video messages to convey his intentions is designed to instill fear and panic as well as to manipulate certain responses that lead to his arrest. The way he escapes through the clever use of a cell phone also shows the advanced mind of someone well versed in premeditation. Joker\u2019s consistency in all areas shows how his character\u2019s personality shows little change.\nDoes he exhibit impaired functioning? I would argue the opposite. Harvey Dent accuses Joker of having \u2018planned\u2019 all of this, to which Joker replies, \u201cDo I really look like a guy with a plan?\u201d of course he is wearing a nurse\u2019s uniform when he says this, another example of how much \u2018planning\u2019 he has actually done to manage to get near Dent who is under police protection. Joker says, \u201cI just do things. I try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. I am an agent of chaos.\u201d Joker says these things, but his actions show advanced strategic planning on multiple levels constantly throughout the film. It takes intellect to \u2018scheme\u2019 as well as he does. The only other character that comes close to understanding the level of the Joker\u2019s threats is Alfred. He forces others to make impossible ethical choices. He uses obfuscation to make people see Batman as the cause of Gotham\u2019s problems, not him. He turns a simple act of Batman refusing to reveal his identity as Batman making a choice to allow people to be killed. But Joker\u2019s anonymity protects him as much as Batman\u2019s protects Bruce Wayne\u2019s. The Joker\u2019s ability to function is not only unimpaired, I\u2019d say it is heightened.\nAs for a disturbed or nonexistent sense of objective reality goes, Joker embodies the object realities that people wish to dismiss, ignore, or completely deny. Dent says, \u201cThe only morality in a cruel world is chance.\u201d That may be true if your morality is only based on equality, but not fairness. Batman says to Alfred, \u201cCriminals aren\u2019t complicated, Alfred. We just need to figure out what he\u2019s after.\u201d Objective reality is something being true outside a person\u2019s own biases or feelings. I challenge anyone to find a statement the Joker makes about society that\u2019s untrue. He tells Batman, \u201cYou either die a hero or you live long enough to become a villain.\u201d This becomes a kind of prophecy by the end of the film. He says, \u201cWhen the chips are down, these civilized people will eat each other.\u201d He sets up his \u2018social experiment\u2019 on the boats to prove this. And while ultimately the two boats don\u2019t blow each other up, they vote on one boat to do it. Joker is correct\u2026they will eat each other, just not while others are looking. The civilized people show a lack of empathy for the criminals on the other boat. It\u2019s understandable to the viewing audience because we see it\u2019s rooted in self-preservation. Just because no one ultimately has the conviction to do it or no one takes the ethical stance of greater good for the greatest number of people, does not prove the Joker\u2019s assessment of society to be wrong. He tells Batman, \u201cYou have all these rules and you think they\u2019ll save you. The only way to live in this world is without rules. Killing is making a choice.\u201d Joker understands truths about our social contracts that we dare not acknowledge. And those that do, we label as crazy. Joker has a keen sense of objective reality. He simply choses to try and alter that reality.\nHe does not hallucinate, nor is he delusional. He knows there are consequences for his actions and at times seems to welcome them, like when Batman is racing towards him in a dead on collision. He stands in the street says, \u201cCome on. Come one. Hit Me!\u201d He\u2019s not schizophrenic. At no time does he lose contact with reality, though at times he feigns insanity for effect. Viewers may judge his actions criminal; however, he is aware that his actions are illegal and he disregards that concept. Not because of a lack of understanding, but a choice. \u201cKilling is making a choice,\u201d remember? He exhibits none of the five subcategories of schizophrenia. He is not paranoid. He is not disorganized. He definitely is not catatonic or undifferentiated. Nor is he residual. So how then can we say he is clinically insane?\nThe only argument I can see supporting this is Ledger\u2019s claim that Joker has zero empathy. He takes life without remorse. He causes damage at every turn. He mercilessly manipulates others to his advantage. But for me, the scene where he goes to see Dent in the hospital is one of the most complex revelations of Joker\u2019s character in the film. He knows what damage he has done to Dent. Yet he goes there trying to give him the words he needs to hear. That it\u2019s okay to be angry. It\u2019s okay to cause chaos and to break the rules. It\u2019s a bizarre tender moment, one in which he even takes Dent by the hand. So there is empathy, though many may not see it that way. It\u2019s not empathy on a grand scale. It\u2019s much more personal. He\u2019s welcoming Dent into the Hall of Freaks that up until now held only himself and the Batman.\nIs the Joker legally insane or just evil?

{"text": "\"Oh, you are stuck on homework problem number 13? I found a solution on YouTube. That helped a lot. Just Google it, you can find all the solutions.\"\nThe second problem is partially my fault. When I give an in-class assessment, I leave the solution out on the front desk so that students can check their answers when they are finished. Instead of studying this and figuring out their mistakes, students will usually just take a quick picture of the solutions using their phone. Of course they ask if it's OK to take a snapshot first, and I let them. However, the problem is that they think of the solution as something to collect rather than something to learn from.\nConfusion is the sweat of learning.\nYou can't just google a physics solution and expect to learn. Imagine if Luke Skywalker had access to the Internet on Dagobah. Here's what would have happened when his x-wing sunk beneath the water.\nYoda: So certain are you? Always with you what cannot be done. Do you nothing that I say?\nLuke: Master moving stones around is one thing, but this is entirely different. But let me just Google \"how to lift an x-wing with the Force.\" Ah. Here it is.\nOf course that's not what happened (I would make this alternate scene into a comic if I could actually draw). Luke learned about the Force by failing. Yes, students learn physics by working on problems and by failing to solve problems. It's the journey to the solution that's important, not the solution itself. Using a video solution would be like using a golf cart to run 5 miles. Sure, you end up in the same place if you run or ride\u2014but they do not produce the same results.\nBut why do students think this? Why do they think learning is as simple as quick search or a photo with their smart phone? There are likely many reasons for students to hold these learning beliefs. However, I popular media often doesn't help. Remember this scene from The Avengers?\nSHIELD agent Maria Hill asks Tony Stark: \"When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\" Stark's answer: \"Last night\". This shows that Tony Stark is so awesome he just figured astrophysics out last night. Clearly, students feel that you have to be a special superhero to understand astrophysics. You either get it in one night, or you'll never get it. I would prefer to have Stark say \"Well, I've been working in this field for 10 years and I'm just scratching the surface.\" Maybe that wouldn't fit too well in the movie.\nOr here's another good one from Days of Thunder.\nCole pulls up to the race track to test out a stock car.\nSee. Learning is simple. You just need to watch some videos and you'll be all set\u2014except when you aren't. Nope. Learning is tough, but it's totally worth it.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T10:30:06Z", "url": "https://www.wired.com/2015/08/learning-physics-tough-get-used/?intcid=inline_amp", "byte_size": 2715, "char_size": 2711}

Thanks.\nI do not want to use it in the variations part because I already put different size variations and the customer can't choose two variations. Thanks.\nThe customer should be able to choose as many variations and products as you have available by adding them to the shopping cart. You can also find short codes for marketpress on the plugin download page. Here is the link. Enjoy!\nI don't think this is actually possible w/o major edits to Marketpress. I may be wrong, but I am fairly familiar with this plugin, and I just don't see this as a simple fix.\nFirst I would create a unique category name for each specific product. Then, I would create a separate product listing for each color. As in, your item in one specific color with all size options as variables. Then, you could keep track of specific inventory of each item in each color and size.\nThen I would create a page in WordPress for each item, and use this shortcode to display all of the items in your product category.\nI created a rather silly example here. Please click on a silly example product to see the individual products availability.\nAnyway, your shopper first chooses a color, and then selects the size. I know it is not exactly what you are looking for, but it does resolve the need for multiple variables, and also allows you to keep track of stock info for all of your offerings.\nSorry I can't be more helpful! I know exactly what you want to be able to do, but this is way outside of my coding capabilities of resolving.\nThanks guys for the help. I think I will have to hard code it in somewhere because in my store I sell vinyl decals and I need my customers to choose from 5 different sizes and 12 different colors. Now putting that many variations for each one seems excessive. The only variation that changes the price is the size.\nI am working on just cloning the variations part of the backend so that I could end up with two \"variations\" that could ask independently with each other and will add another drop down menu. I am messing around with the marketplace.php and I feel like I am close to my goal. I was able to clone the variation table in the backend but I can't seem to make the second one independent from the first one. Please take a look at my marketplace.php file here: http://pastebin.com/Bn0Gf8HX.\nAs mentioned here, multiple variations are not yet an option unfortunately.\nUnfortunately if you need multiple variations then you would require a developer. If you have separate unique entries for variations then I suspect that your code is either saving and using the default variation still or the code pulling the contents is pulling the wrong ones.\nThanks Timothy! I just upgraded and I think I can make the custom fields work for me. The only thing now that will make it perfect is if I could ad a picture of all my color choices at the \"Bottom\" of the checkout page. Is there a way to change the image location on the checkout page so that the picture is by the required text box?\nWould the colour be the features image?\nI think that could be included in the but if its just an image in the content or a custom field then it would require more work.\nI did personally request that this item actually appear on the product page as that seemed in my mind the most logical placement for it rather than waiting until checkout. However with this release it is on the shipping page.\nI was just checking on the old threads to see if we missed out something and found that we are still waiting to hear on this one from ya.\nPlease advise how things are going on this one !\nHey guys! I have finally found a way to let my customers pick a color without having to mess with any code.

{"text": "Architect Elisabetta Rizzato was born and raised just outside of Venice, Italy. After 31 years, it might seem safe to assume she\u2019d bore of the sights, spots and surroudings of this great, tourist-rich locale, but rather, the opposite is true. Elisabetta continually discovers amazing new places and hidden gems which she shares on her blog ITALIANBARK, along with plenty of posts on interior design, and her work as an architect.\nStart your day with the best coffee in Venice. Located close to the railway station, Torrefazione Cannaregio is a must.\nOpened in 1930, this is the oldest coffee shop in town and offers many different kinds of coffees, toasted in-house with a big, old coffee machine. I recommend the Remer blend, a coffee you can only drink here as it\u2019s a secret recipe!\nTake a morning walk in Sestiere Cannaregio and visit the workshop of a marionette maker called L\u2019isola di Pinocchio.\nIt may be hidden behind an ordinary door, in an ancient mezzanine, but here you will step into a magical place, surrounded by handmade marionettes by an amazing artisan.\nLibreria Acqua Alta bookshop, in Sestiere Castello, is one of the most original bookshops in the world.\nSelling vintage and new books, this place is literally filled with books everywhere, displayed in boats, gondolas, bathtubs, etc. It\u2019s also located between two of my favorite corners of Venice: one is Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo, situated in front of the stunning Scuola Grande di San Marco (which has since become the city hospital).\nThe other corner is Campo San Lorenzo. In this spot, you will see one of the three bent bell-towers of the city. The one of San Giorgio dei Greci church is almost as crooked as the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa! But, I digress. After grabbing a book, find a bench and enjoy it.\nBefore lunchtime, head to Rialto.\nCross the world-famous bridge and enjoy some fresh fruit and fish in the ancient market of the town, Mercato di Rialto. Despite being a very famous one, it is still a genuine Venetian market where you will find locals buying fresh fish. It has also recently been listed as one of the 10 best markets in the world by The Guardian. If you are wondering where the vegetables and fruit come from, they\u2019re from an island near Venice called \u201cl\u2019orto di Venezia,\u201d Sant\u2019Erasmo, almost entirely covered with fields!\nEnjoy sunshine at Le Zattere after an \u201combra\u201d (glass of wine) and some \u201ccicchetti\u201d (Venetian fingerfood), then head south for a proper lunch to Sestiere Dorsoduro. Here, you will find many bars and small \u201cbacari\u201d (typical Venice \u201costerie\u201d) to enjoy something fast. I recommend a deviation to the Bacareto da Lele, a really small corner with amazing small paninis and good wine! It was my favorite bacaro during my university years and is still very popular in town by locals. Alternatively, enjoy lunch at Fondamenta delle zattere, at the southern edge of the city. Facing Giudecca Channel, it is the best place to enjoy the sun and take a long walk afterwards. Its name comes from the zattere, a la the historic rafts that were docked here to store the city\u2019s timber. It is also the best place to enjoy an ice cream, maybe at Gelateria da Nico , loved by Penny Guggenheim and Angelina Jolie, and famous for its Gianduiotto. It\u2019s also the best starting point for an afternoon stroll among the best shops!\nEven if it\u2019s crowded with tourists, Accademia area in Sestiere Dorsoduro has always been one of my favorites. It is really filled with culture and art and has recently become a real art-walk, thanks to the Venice Museum Mile project. Here, you can choose between contemporary art at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection and Punta della Dogana, historical paintings at Gallerie dell\u2019Accademia, and many other museums and historical palaces\u2026all within a one-mile radius! Don\u2019t forget to visit Biennale and its collateral events between May and November!\nHere, we are in the best area for some good shopping in Venice. Near Accademia, you will find some of the most original design shops in town, such as the incredible Fiorella Gallery (if you are lucky enough to find it open, as it doesn\u2019t abide by regular hours). Within a few steps you will also find Venetia Studium, a historical shop selling wonderful fabrics, as well as the amazing \u2014 and often imitated \u2014 Fortuny Lamps. It\u2019s very expensive, I know, but if you are a design-lover you can\u2019t not love them! Next, head to Mercerie area, a trio of streets between Piazza San Marco and Rialto, for the most famous brands. This is the \u201cshopping district\u201d of Venice!\nFor aperitivo (appetizers) and dinner, head far from the tourist traps to Fondamenta della Misericordia, in a northern direction back to Sestiere Cannaregio. Here you will enjoy a gorgeous sunset. It is also one of the city areas where locals can relax, unwind and enjoy dinnertime.\nWalk across the Judish Ghetto \u2014 one of the most fascinating places in Venice \u2014 and enjoy an aperitivo in one of the bars you will find along the Fondamenta, such as Vino Vero, a brand new spot where you can sip your wine outside around a briccole (wooden poles in the water transformed into small tables)!\nIn this area, there are also many good, affordable restaurants there are not too crowded. Here in fondamenta della Misericordia, you will find Paradiso Perduto, a typical Venetian restaurant founded by four students with a very spartan mood and fresh food. Five minutes from here, towards Strada Nuova, Osteria alla Vedova is another good spot. With its lovely, retro interior and its delicious polpettas, you will not be disappointed!\nIf you are still not tired after this day in Venice, you can head to another area of the city where university students hang out (I sure did as a student)! The spot is called Campo Santa Margherita, and it\u2019s crowded with osterie and bars. On your way there, don\u2019t forget to deviate towards another magical corner in Venice, Squero San Trovaso, where you will see the officina, one of the last gondola craftmakers left in town.\nWhile this is just an overview (and maybe this day could last 48 hours, actually!), there\u2019s plenty more great reasons to spend time in Venice\u2026 Just think, we haven\u2019t even gotten to Piazza San Marco!\nwhat a great guide to Venice! Bookmarking for my next visit.\nThanks \u2013 perfect timing! We are landing in Venice this June, after a Seabourn cruise through the Adriatic. Any suggestions for the best area to shop for antiques?\nWonderful suggestions :) I know Venice really well and I love (and know) about half the places you\u2019ve mentioned \u2013 really off the beaten path and some stunning quiet corners \u2013 so now I\u2019ve some new ones to add next time.\nI would love to eat my way around Italy. Saving towards this dream trip!\nThe historic texture of the city is truly fascinating.\nI would like to go with certainty in the summer holiday.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T15:38:14Z", "url": "https://www.designsponge.com/2015/12/24-hours-in-venice-italy.html", "byte_size": 6906, "char_size": 6822}
{"text": "A yoga therapy session is probably a lot more than what you think if you have never been to one before. Those that have not experienced yoga think it is just a bunch of poses that don\u2019t mean anything. In reality, there is a reason behind each practice. The benefits of yoga are limitless, but you have to attend a session to understand it fully.\nWhen you attend just one yoga therapy session, you will uncover the profound healing that occurs with the practice. Students learn how to be more mindful and how to listen to what their inner wisdom is telling them.\nTension, trauma, belief, and self-perceptions can all be released with proper posturing during a yoga session. The first experience is one that many people never forget. It becomes something that is depended on for relaxation, focus, and a healthy lifestyle by those that are dedicated to it.\nConnecting the mind, body, and heart is the primary goal in a yoga therapy session. To do that properly, it must be customized to the individual. That is how he or she will get the most out of their class. A qualified instructor knows how to put together a program that suits each person\u2019s specific needs and skill levels.\nPart of each program of a yoga therapy session is a commitment to linking the body, mind, and spirit in a healthy way. There are generally breathing practices, meditation, visualizations, and various yoga postures completed during every appointment.\nBy doing each of the exercises, or poses during a class, the student is going to discover a lot out about themselves. There is also a feeling of release, healing, and growth that happens while being active in yoga.\nJust about everyone is going to find some sort of benefit from a yoga therapy session. There is proof that it helps with a variety of injuries, illnesses, and various mental health issues. Depression, anxiety, trauma, grief, chronic pain, and even relationship problems have been overcome successfully with yoga.\nNot only will you get what you need from your yoga therapy session with a professional instructor, but you will take it with you. It is not like going to the gym. You walk in, work out, and go home. With a yoga therapy session, you leave with techniques to use in relationships, daily life, and with the world as a whole.\nThe main concern of your instructor is to explore your physical, emotional, and spiritual self in a safe and supportive way. The satisfaction of the client is always the number one priority for an empathetic and educated yoga teacher.\nAre you ready to explore a yoga therapy session? If you answered yes, now is the time to call us. We will point you in the right direction. Find a class level that is suited to your specific needs. You can also get a private lesson for a more individualized experience.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T02:09:16Z", "url": "http://www.reaveschiro.com/yoga-river-north-chicago/yoga-therapy-session/", "byte_size": 2786, "char_size": 2782}

{"text": "HOW do we explain why 5.5m French voters in the first round of the presidential elections voted for far-right parties that are xenophobic, anti-semitic, racist and ultra-nationalist? Sounding off about the wrongness of the vote will not help understand the reasons underlying their choice. Everybody in politics needs to begin an urgent, thorough and much-needed self-criticism.\nThe vote may have been a valuable wake-up call for France if it opens the eyes of party leaders and revives the debate on how to build a nation based on justice and solidarity. What vanished in April was the comforting thought that although everything was changing in the world outside, in French politics everything could stay the same; that two ageing parties, the Gaullists and the Socialists, could share power as they had done for 30 years.\nPeople have sensed for some time that these two political forces are worn out. Their historic mission seems to have ended. Each in its own way gives the impression of an organisation going nowhere, with crumbling infrastructures, no organisation or programme, no ideology, no identity and no compass for the journey ahead.\nPrevious elections had already shown that neither party was capable of addressing the needs of millions of people who are genuinely frightened by the new realities of the post-industrial world that has emerged after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war. The disposable workers, the underclasses of the banlieues, the long-term unemployed, the excluded, the many people pushed into early retirement, the young people in precarious jobs, the families on the brink of poverty. For all these, the recent past has brought years of fear and anxiety, with many familiar landmarks apparently gone forever.\nThe Socialist party in particular, with almost no working-class people in its local organisations and several leaders in the supertax bracket, gives the impression that it lives on another planet, light years from the experiences of ordinary people. It has shown itself remarkably insensitive to what Daniel Mermet describes as \u201cthe sufferings of under-France\u201d.\nWhat about the right? Some conservative politicians see the far right as untouchable, but others have been happy to do electoral deals with it. The former liberal leader, Michel Poniatowski, recently wondered in public whether it was \u201cany more immoral to accept the votes of communists, who murdered millions of people in Europe, than those of the National Front\u201d (1). This perverse logic allowed Christian Democrat leaders of the Union pour la d\u00e9mocratie fran\u00e7aise (UDF) to accept National Front votes in 1998 to be elected to the presidency of five French regions.\nWhile this plague infected the inner workings of France\u2019s political institutions, was it reasonable to imagine that France would remain immune to the upsurge of far-right politics in its immediate neighbours (see Fascism isn\u2019t what it used to be, by Jean-Yves Camus, in this issue)? Or likely that France would be the exception when, like other European countries, its social fabric has been violently rent in the name of modernity: by liberalism and globalisation, European unification, the decline in national sovereignty, the abandonment of the franc, the disappearance of national borders, the hegemony of the United States, multiculturalism, loss of identity and the crisis of the welfare state?\nAll this happened in the context of the end of the industrial era and technological transformations that led to widespread economic insecurity and terrible social malaise. In such a context, with competition raised to the status of a natural imperative, an increase in violence and criminality was inevitable. The abruptness and brutality of these changes meant that uncertainties are accumulating as horizons have been lost, the world seems less clear, and history appears to defy logic and understanding. Ordinary people have felt abandoned by governments of both right and left; unsurprisingly, since the press describes them as corrupt, as liars and cheats.\nMany people feel lost and panicky; as Tocqueville put it,\"since the past no longer illuminates the present, the human spirit walks in darkness\". Old magicians have returned to conjure with this new obscurantism, this breeding-ground of fear, confusion and resentment. Their rhetoric is demagogic, authoritarian and racist; they talk of a return to the old values (work, family, motherland) and blame foreigners, Arabs and Jews for all the disorders, social problems and insecurities. Immigrants are an easy target, always available, because they symbolise social upheavals, and among the lowest-income earners they are seen as unwanted competition.\nAlthough it is absurd, hateful and even criminal, the rhetoric of the National Front has long appealed to more than one in four French people according to the opinion polls (2). On 21 April it gained the electoral approval of millions (30% of the unemployed, 24% of workers, 20% of young people and 17% of employers).\nThe Republican awakening expressed in street demonstrations all over France translated into anti-Le Pen votes on 5 May. Neo-fascism will not be voted in during the parliamentary elections in June either. But once the moment of fear has passed, if the parties carry on as before, with privatisation, dismantling public services, creating pension funds and accepting sackings to keep shareholders happy, if they continue to deny people\u2019s desires for a society that is fairer, more fraternal, more based on solidarity \u2014 then there is no guarantee that fascism, in alliance with the usual collaborators, will not win next time.\n(1) Lib\u00e9ration, 20 March 1998.\n(2) Le Monde, 13 April 1996.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T11:47:10Z", "url": "https://mondediplo.com/2002/05/01plague", "byte_size": 5730, "char_size": 5711}

{"text": "I\u2019ve never applied for a passport, because until now, I didn\u2019t really feel I needed one. With no plans to travel outside my home country, it seemed just a hollow gesture to apply. In this way, I am not unlike millions of people who go through life without a passport, since they feel the same way I do. This is a perfect analogy of life in general, and life after death specifically. Some people are not interested in having another life after this one, they don\u2019t wonder about the future, they see no need in believing it\u2019s true, because they don\u2019t intend to go there. Ignorance is not bliss.\nBelieving in the \u201chereafter\u201d in many ways requires a spiritual passport. A person has to first become convinced there is a life in the hereafter, and that they want to go there. This step alone is a tiny act of faith, since none of the current world religious systems offer any clear evidence of another life after this one, except Christianity. The Case for Christ movie begins next week, and in my opinion is a must-see for every person wanting more information about why Christianity\u2019s claims are true. Here\u2019s my shortened version.\nGod offers every person a passport to the life He designed for us to have, with a place for us to live in constant community with Him. The passport fees have already been paid by His Son, Jesus. The passport is issued with a NEW NAME, because we are going to a NEW COUNTRY.\nHe who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it.\nHe who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will not go out from it anymore; and I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new name.\nOld Testament patriarchs, kings, and prophets all new the truth of this place and this passport found in a person called Messiah. David and Isaiah wrote about God\u2019s provision for His people.\nBut now, thus says the LORD, your Creator, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel, \u201cDo not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine! When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, nor will the flame burn you.\nThese Old & New Testament verses help us understand that God has made a provision to take every believer to a newly created place that was very much like Eden, yet entrance is attainable only through a specific faith statement. Jesus gave us the specific criteria for our application on this spiritual passport.\nThis kingdom of God, the next life after this one, is described in at least a few details, in the last book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation. Revelation 21 describes a new heaven, a new earth, and a new Jerusalem. Revelation 22 describes two attributes of this new earth, that sustain life for all who dwell there: the River of Life, and the Tree of Life. In the last few verses of the last book in the Bible, Jesus gives a very interesting command to John, who is recording all this information for us.\nAnd he said to me, \u201cDo not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near. Let the one who does wrong, still do wrong; and the one who is filthy, still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous, still practice righteousness; and the one who is holy, still keep himself holy. Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\nThis one phrase \u201cdo not seal up\u201d means that the main message and theme of the Book of Revelation can be read, and understood, by those who seek truth regarding the consummation of human history and what happens when this life is over. The spiritual passport that God makes available to every human is clearly seen in this book. The hope of an afterlife that is real and desired is clearly seen in this book. If you would like to know more, there is a bible study book available by clicking here. Want hope for the afterlife?

{"text": "Print, cut, fold, glue, fly! This is a simple design for a flying dragon that is perfect for flying indoors or outdoors in a light breeze. From the first cut to the finished dragon, expect to spend 50 minutes. If you have no prior experience making paper or model airplanes, it may take over an hour.\nPrint the PDF onto card stock (or onto plain paper, then photocopy it onto card stock). Use approximately 80 lb. card stock. Use any color that strikes your fancy.\nIf you intend to print double sided (so bones will be visible on the top of the wing) you may need to experiment with the photocopy machine or printer to get good alignment between the two sides.\nHere are the materials. The green paper is simply a work surface that prevents glue from getting on the table. The matte knife (utility knife) is not entirely necessary. If you are a child or adolescent and want to use a matte knife, ask an adult for assistance and use it with caution. Put a cutting board or other durable material under the card stock before cutting it so that you don't damage the table.\nCut them out very carefully. Be patient with this step.\nThe instructions are covered in this short video. Here are some parts of an airplane you'll need to know in order to best build, fly, and adjust the dragon.\nThe dragons pictured in this Instructable are color designs that I sell online. The PDF you downloaded is black and white. If you wish to color your dragon (which would be fun and totally worth it) be weary of using markers. The moisture in the markers may cause the paper to ruffle and warp. Colored pencils are probably the safest option. Like a good engineer, you can do tests with markers and pencils on your scrap material.\nLook down the nose of the dragon and make sure there are no twists or bends in the fuselage. If there are any, gently straighten them out. Check the wings, too. Make sure the left and right sides of the wing are raised to the same height. Check the vertical and horizontal stabilizers for warps and symmetry. Check the dragon and make adjustments after every few flights. This will ensure proper flight. Avoid water and damp ground.\nPut small paper clip (no. 1 size) if you are flying the dragon indoors, or if you want the dragon to do loops and turns. Use a large paper clip if your want a longer, straighter flight, or if you are flying outdoors and there is a breeze. You can adjust the rudder and elevators to change the flight characteristics of the dragon. Note that the elevators should never be set at a downward angle, as this will cause the dragon to pitch down and crash.\nWARNING\u2014 The glider can cause eye injury. Advise those around you before you throw it, and consider wearing glasses to protect your own eyes.\nIf you enjoyed this Instructable, you can support my creative projects by going to www.etsy.com/shop/zdedesigns and liking my shop, or by liking the YouTube video you watched.

{"text": "When I would go to the beach as a kid, I would sometimes emerge from the water with these slimy, smelly plants around my ankles. I used to see that and think it was gross. Now I see seaweed and think about recipes to use it in.\nCooking with sea veggies is still a new concept for some people. Sure, we eat it when we dine on vegan sushi and maybe even add a few kelp flakes to a vegan \u201cfish\u201d recipe. For most people, sea veggies are not an item on their weekly shopping list. They\u2019ve been used for thousands of years in Asian cooking and now they are gaining in popularity and becoming easier to find in mainstream grocery stores. If you\u2019re not sure about how to cook with seaweed or if you even want to, I\u2019m here to help you conquer your fear of sea veggies and encourage you to try cooking with them at home.\n1.

Besides, who wants to see the word \u201calgae\u201d on a menu? Sea veggies include many marine algae varieties found in the water and along the coast. Sea veggies come in red, green, brown and yellow colors and multiple varieties. Seaweed can be eaten raw or cooked and add a salty, umami flavor to foods. To learn more, read All You Ever Wanted to Know About Sea Vegetables: Kelps, Noris, Oh My!\nBefore we get to how to cook with sea veggies, let\u2019s look at why we should. Seaweed is considered a superfood. The oldest plant family on Earth, sea vegetables are packed with more nutrients than any other plant. They have been used for centuries to treat many health problems. Sea veggies are a great source of iodine, vitamins A, C, E and B vitamins. They are filled with antioxidants and have detoxification and antibiotic properties. Sea veggies are also rich in protein, calcium, magnesium and fiber. To learn even more about the health benefits of sea veggies, see Seaweed Decoded: Why It\u2019s Essential on a Vegan Diet.\nHow you use sea veggies depends on the type of seaweed you\u2019re using. There are well over 10,000 types of seaweed. Most need to be rehydrated so they can be added easily to soups. Nori, used to wrap sushi, can be eaten dry. Seaweed can be added to salads like this Easy Seaweed Salad and this Seaweed Salad with Toasted Sesame Dressing. It can also be fried or dehydrated to make crispy snacks or added to stir-fries. Let\u2019s look at how to use the most common types of seaweed.\nNori, a type of red algae, is the one you\u2019re probably most familiar with. It\u2019s the flaky, dark green seaweed used to wrap sushi. It\u2019s also used as a garnish on salads and in miso soup. It\u2019s usually sold in full sheets for sushi wrapping. Learn How to Make a Nori Roll and then try these Super Easy Nori Hand Rolls With Avocado Dressing, Nori Wrap With Sweet Potato, Avocado and Miso Dressing, and these Unbelievably Raw Vegan Nori Wraps with Spicy Dipping Sauce. Nori has also become popular as a toasted snack to eat like chips. Try these Raw Vegan Noritos to try it yourself.\nWakame is usually used in salads and miso soups. It is sold dried and needs to be rehydrated. The taste is mildly sweet. Try it in these Spring Rolls with Wakame and Kabocha Squash Stuffed With Black Rice, Kale and Wakame. It is also used in this recipe for Vegan \u201cFish\u201d Sauce.\nDulse is a red sea veggie sold in flakes. It\u2019s used in soups, stir-fries and I use it a lot to add that \u201cfishy\u201d flavor to my vegan seafood dishes. Use dulse in this Garden and Sea Pate, \u2018Crab\u2019 Cakes with Green Tartar Sauce, and Chickpea \u2018Tuna\u2019 Salad.\nArame is a dark brown seaweed that is sold dehydrated. It has a semi-sweet flavor and can be used on salads or in stir-fries. Use arame in this Spicy Asian Cucumber Avocado Onion Salad and in this Delicious No-Bone Broth.\nKelp is one of the more commonly eaten sea veggies. It can be added to any recipe for a salty, umami flavor. Kelp flakes are used in this Tempeh \u2018Fish\u2019 N\u2019 Chips with Tartar Sauce and in these Vegan Tofu Scallops. It can also be eaten in the form of kelp noodles. You\u2019ll love these Kelp Noodles in Peanut-Miso Sauce and Vegan Chili Kelp Noodles.\nSpirulina is a deep sea green algae and is considered a superfood. It is high in protein, B-vitamins and antioxidants as well as other nutrients. In fact, spirulina contains so many vitamins and minerals, it is like taking a complete multivitamin. You can buy spirulina in powder or tablet form. Check out The Top 5 Reasons You Need More Spirulina in Your Life and How to Sneak Spirulina into Tasty Recipes for a Nutrient Boost. Try it in this Tropical Green Spirulina Smoothie, Six Ingredient Spirulina Snackies and this Vegan Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream.\nAgar-Agar is commonly used in vegan baking and in making vegan cheeses because of its thickening properties. It is sold in flake or solid form and unlike other algae, appears white. Use agar agar in this Almost Raw Panna Cotta Cream, Almond and Chamomile Panna Cotta, Vegan Rice Krispie Treats and Sliceable Vegan Cashew Cheese.\nNow that you know all about sea veggies, how good they are for you and all the delicious recipes they can be used in, it\u2019s time to grow your sea legs and jump in to the deep end. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be cooking with sea veggies all the time.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T12:38:56Z", "url": "https://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/cooking-with-sea-veggies/", "byte_size": 5473, "char_size": 5403}

Included was the prohibition of both female and male sterilization: the tubal ligation and the vasectomy. In some instances, Catholic hospitals continue to perform forbidden procedures to keep the business of a not devoutly Catholic populous. In order to determine the degree of adherence to the ethical guidelines, post partum tubal ligations and vasectomies were tabulated for hospitals in the Ascension Health group in Texas. The data demonstrated that the hospitals are performing these procedures at similar rates as non-Catholic hospitals in the state.

{"text": "How do you feel when you take a look at your home\u2019s exterior. If you suddenly notice one day that it\u2019s looking lackluster, it\u2019s no surprise. Many of us spend so much time indoors that we forget to perfect the look of the outside.\nWhen you think about home improvement, you often go through all of the fine details of the house in your head. You think about everything from top to bottom \u2013 how to keep everything clean and hygienic, and also how to improve every inch to make it all look as pretty as possible. Everyone wants to live in the best possible home, so they focus a lot of energy into making the interior of the place close to perfect.\nWhat goes into the house is super important, but it\u2019s just a select part of your entire home. The aspects that sit on the outside of the home also need some love and some work. First impressions are important, and people aren\u2019t exactly going to see inside the home when they stand on the outside. There are a bunch of components that make up a home\u2019s exterior, here are a few ideas to help spruce up and shore up the outside.\nWhether your drive is concrete or compacted soil (like this one in the UK), keep it clean and in perfect repair. It makes the first impression of your home\u2019s exterior.\nThe first place anyone reaches as they enter your home\u2019s space. The driveway isn\u2019t always seen as the most glamorous part of a home, but they can definitely be made to look very attractive if given enough time and care.\nIf the driveway is looking a little weathered, then it probably does have something to do with the years of damage caused by it \u2013 even if a driveway is fairly new, it can look as though it has been around for decades only after a couple of years.\nThe best course of action here is to take a pressure washer and blast away at the dirt that has been collected. You\u2019d be surprised at how youthful it can look after a good clean. You could also add some little extras in there like lights or borders to give it something more than just a plain look.\nA garden is the crowning glory of your home\u2019s exterior.\nThe garden should be a place to clear minds and feel complete bliss. If you have a garden that is fairly packed with different things, perhaps think about having a little clear-out and starting with somewhat of a blank canvas.\nPeople like to have little areas in their garden to sit in and relax \u2013 with a bit of work, you could get some chairs, get some plants, maybe half a dozen pieces of landscaping stone and a few other things, and you could have yourself your own little area. You could give the fences and gates a little paint if they look as though they\u2019re fading a little.\nIn terms of the bricks of the house, they\u2019re in a similar boat to the driveway in that they can begin to look a little aged quite easily. It\u2019s another case of blasting it with the pressure washer and seeing the results \u2013 be careful though; you don\u2019t want to make a mess for the neighbors.\nIf you have a garage and you don\u2019t use it for parking your car in there, then you could give it a little clean \u2013 a lot of unused and needless items are stored in one\u2019s garage, you could spend a day just sorting through all of the stuff in there.\nYou could go one further and renovate it completely. If it\u2019s left alone for a lot of the time, you may elect to turn it into a more practical place.\nAddressing your home\u2019s exterior can polish up your dulled curb appeal with your investment of time and labor.\nPosted on April 10, 2019 by Deborah TayloePosted in DIY ProjectsTagged DIY, DIY Landscaping, DIY Projects, home exterior, home's exterior, landscaping.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T10:25:46Z", "url": "https://diyhomegarden.blog/2019/04/10/4-aspects-of-enhancing-your-homes-exterior/", "byte_size": 3637, "char_size": 3589}

If you want to watch the most exciting hockey in Texas, then the Stars are your best bet, so purchase your Dallas Stars tickets today!\nBefore the Stars became Dallas residents, the franchise was originated in Minnesota as the North Stars in 1967 as one of six new expansion teams in the NHL. After spending 26 years in Minnesota, the franchise was relocated to Dallas, adopting \u201cStars\u201d as their team name. With a fresh start in a new city, the Stars wasted no time in making their presence known throughout the NHL, as they advanced to the postseason, sweeping the St. Louis Blues in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, but eventually ousted by the Vancouver Canucks in the Western Conference Semifinals.\nThe Stars built upon their inaugural season success, and in 1998-1999, Dallas set franchise records by winning 51 regular season games and earning the team\u2019s first President\u2019s Trophy for having the best record in the NHL. Advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals, the Stars went on to defeat the Buffalo Sabres in six games, led by the scoring prowess of Mike Modano and Brett Hull, as well as the stellar goaltending of Ed Belfour, to claim Dallas\u2019 first Stanley Cup Championship.\nAlthough the Stars have yet to replicate their 1998-1999 championship season, the Stars have had numerous playoff runs in their ensuing years, and are even more driven to return to the Stanley Cup Playoffs this season.

{"text": "PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION: WHEN GETTING PREGNANT GETS YOU FIRED.\nAlthough terminating someone\u2019s employment because they are pregnant has been against the law since 1978 when the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was first passed it does not stop some Minnesota employers from blatantly firing someone simply for being pregnant. Take the case of a woman who told her employer she was pregnant at the beginning of her second trimester. Her employer\u2019s immediate response was \u201cThat\u2019s not going to work.\u201d She was fired the following day for no other reason than announcing her pregnancy.\nHer employer simply said that since the company was small, it cannot afford to cover her when she would be on leave to have her baby. Then there are the numerous cases where pregnant workers are forced to take unpaid leave immediately upon announcing their pregnancy status. The forced time off is not based on a medical need or even requests for special accommodations such as lifting or other physical restrictions, but on an employer\u2019s erroneous assumptions about the worker\u2019s ability to do her job.\nThen when the worker really needs to take time off, they have already exhausted their allotted time and are fired. Some employees are discriminated against over fears about how customers may perceive or react to, for example a pregnant restaurant server. The majority of female employees subjected to pregnancy discrimination are low-wage workers who really need to work as long as possible throughout their pregnancy.\nBut there appears to be hope on the horizon for pregnant women. The EEOC commissioner recently said that EEOC has chosen three legal issues involving discrimination where it wants to have an impact. One issue includes whether or not employers should be required to accommodate pregnant workers. Many women\u2019s advocacy groups are pushing for changes to the ADA that in 2008, already expanded the definition of disability to include temporary disabilities.\nNo one should be discriminated against based on a disability, temporary or not and employees in Minnesota and elsewhere do have rights when it comes to the Family and Medical Leave Act as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act. Now the question seems to be whether a woman\u2019s medical needs in relation to her pregnancy should be protected as a temporary disability.\nPregnancy discrimination is illegal and if the EEOC clarifies the language to include pregnancy-related disabilities, perhaps fewer women will be discriminated against in the workplace.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T12:56:36Z", "url": "http://www.halunenlaw.com/pregnancy-discrimination-when-getting-pregnant-gets-you-fired/", "byte_size": 2526, "char_size": 2508}

{"text": "Background: It is uncertain whether vitamin B-12 supplementation can improve neurophysiologic function in asymptomatic elderly with low vitamin B-12 status or whether folate status affects responses to vitamin B-12 supplementation. Objective: We assessed the effects of a single intramuscular injection of 10 mg vitamin B-12 (which also contained 100 mg vitamin B-6 and 100 mg vitamin B-1) on vitamin B-12 status and neurophysiologic function in elderly community-dwelling Chileans with low serum vitamin B-12 concentrations who were consuming bread fortified with folic acid. Design: A pretreatment and posttreatment study was conducted in 51 participants (median +/- SD age: 73 +/- 3 y; women: 47%) with serum vitamin B-12 concentrations <120 pmol/L at screening. Vitamin B-12 status was defined by combining vitamin B-12, plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), methylmalonic acid (MMA), and holtranscobalmin into one variable [combined indicator of vitamin B-12 status (cB-12)]. The response to treatment was assessed by measuring cB-12 and neurophysiologic variables at baseline and 4 mo after treatment. Results: Treatment increased serum vitamin B-12, holotranscobalamin, and cB-12 (P < 0.001) and reduced plasma tHcy and serum MMA (P < 0.001). Treatment produced consistent improvements in conduction in myelinated peripheral nerves; the sensory latency of both the left and right sural nerves improved on the basis of faster median conduction times of 3.1 and 3.0 ms and 3.3 and 3.4 ms, respectively (P < 0.0001). A total of 10 sensory potentials were newly observed in sural nerves after treatment. Participants with high serum folate at baseline (above the median, >= 33.9 nmol/L) had less improvement in cB-12 (P < 0.001) than did individuals whose serum folate was less than the median concentration (i.e., with a concentration <33.9 nmol/L). Conclusion: Asymptomatic Chilean elderly with poor vitamin B-12 status displayed improved conductivity in myelinated peripheral nerves after vitamin B-12 treatment and an interaction with folate status, which was detected only with the use of cB-12.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T09:01:41Z", "url": "http://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/138486", "byte_size": 2099, "char_size": 2099}
{"text": "Another pattern inspired by FlyFishFood.com. Very similar to their \u201cBelly Scratcher Minnow\u201d. You can follow the link to purchase the original version from Cheech and the gang. The signature feature of this fly is the tungsten weights tied to the belly that make the fly ride hook point up. This is a very useful technique that allows you to tie in various amounts of weight without using lead eyes. You can expect more sink than the \u201cNeutral Minnow\u201d because of this weight, but it will be both a subtle and level drop, instead of the jigging motion of a front weighted fly. Although this pattern is effective in still water, I prefer it in rivers as a strong pattern for both trout and smallmouth.

{"text": "This is a short but enthralling walk, possibly the nicest coastal walk in Ireland: it\u2019s a walk to take at your ease, to stop, look around, sit and listen.\nNormally the promotional photo for a hike aims to attract, often with sunlit mountain and sea and a high blue sky; and it works especially well if it features a distant summer-clad hiker taking it all in. Unfortunately, the hiker seduced to our west coast by such a photo can be in for a disappointment!\nAnd so it was for us in mid-August in Glencolumbkille: a moist warm sector airstream had narrowed our world to a 200m deep slot between grey sea and grey sky. Within this space, as we drove to our start point in Glencolumbkille and to our carsplit finish in Port, mists rose and fell over wet hedges and heather, all seeming to make for an unattractive hiking prospect.\nExcept that, just north of the Napoleonic Watchtower on Glen Head, we quite unexpectedly happened upon an utterly beautiful world that had our heads and hearts reeling. Why was that, we asked ourselves? Well, the beauty that came to us that day on that wonderfully wild and ragged coastline, between the low grey sky and a swirling, noisy sea of dramatic white and sky-grey, was not \u201cpicture postcard perfect\u201d, but magical in its ever-changing, elemental play of cloud, sound, sea and rock. And it brought home to us the wonder of the shore and sea, especially our Atlantic Ocean, as walking companions or backdrop in all but the very worst of conditions.\nThis is a short but enthralling walk, possibly the nicest coastal walk in Ireland: it\u2019s a walk to take at your ease, to stop, look around, sit and listen. We started at Biof\u00e1n, about 1.5km from Glencolumbkille, and progressed in low mood and mist to the signal tower just north of Glen Head. Soon we were in from under the curtain of mist, with truly awe-inspiring Sturrall pitched before us. Easy cropped grass underfoot allowed us safely to admire this shattered quartzite sea ar\u00eate, with its fresh and ancient scars of battle with the wildest of Atlantic storms. Below and around it were surf-girdled sea-stack remnants, some undercut into dramatic sea arches. Wraiths of mist rolled up its windward flank, obscuring the sea but seemingly accentuating its sound - a great place to stop for lunch and to appreciate the immense privilege of just being there.\nSoon great stream-cut ravines interrupted the route, forcing encircling swings inland or aerobic descents and ascents, until the wild shore of Port came into view. By now for us, the mist had thickened, adding even more to the age-old elemental \u201cfeel\u201d of the place.\nWe meandered carefully the indentations of the coast, staying inside a restraining ditch and fence, joined the marked trail to our car in Port and stood beside the memorial to the 19 crew members lost on the \u201cSydney\u201d in November 1870. Meanwhile, the arriving rain and enshrouding mist, and thoughts of the terror of the sea as well as its beauty, added a sombre note to the end of our hike!\nSuitability: easy to moderate, care needed on off-trail sections near cliff edges, especially in windy weather.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T01:56:17Z", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/travel/this-is-possibly-the-nicest-coastal-walk-in-ireland-1.3636999", "byte_size": 3131, "char_size": 3113}
{"text": "That quote perfectly sums up the sound of Los Angeles-based rock quartet The Slow Signal Fade.\nOn the band's debut full-length, \"Steady\" (In Music We Trust Records), the band further explores these elements, seemingly integrating them and making them their own, creating a record that famed studio wizard Steve Albini (P.J. Harvey, Nirvana, The Pixies) is proud to have worked on.\nNow, how did Albini end up working with The Slow Signal Fade?\nFans of Low's 'Things We Lost In The Fire', The Pixies' 'Surfer Rosa', PJ Harvey's 'Rid Of Me', and Nirvana's 'In Utero', all records Albini worked on, The Slow Signal Fade knew he was their man. Plus, he still uses tape rather than Pro Tools, something the band cherishes (their experience with computers in the past have left them less than impressed).\nWith their mind set on Albini, they set out to make their dream a reality.\nThe first step in achieving this, as the band will tell you, is putting vocalist Marguerite Olivelle on the phone. \"We always do that with band stuff, because she's a girl and is nice and cute,\" the band laughs in unison.\nOnce they were in communication with Albini through his Chicago-based studio, Electrical Audio, they followed up with some music, corresponded via email, and eventually found a week in his busy schedule that worked for both parties - and booked studio time.\nThey then packed their bags, got in a van, with their instruments, and were Chicago bound.\nCrediting the trip to Chicago as one of the best musical, and life experiences they've each ever had, the band spent seven sleepless days at Electrical Audio, working with Albini to create a record they are beaming about, one they feel will help them reach a wider audience and turn some industry ears as well. That record is \"Steady\", their debut full-length.\n\"Steady\" is a record about experience, about life, lyrically and musically canvassing the good, bad, serious, silly, happy, and sad situations you find yourself in while living life to the fullest.\n\"The record is about staying 'steady' in life, and taking good times and bad ones and learning from them,\" explains the band. \"It's why the bubble in the level isn\u00b9t quite in the center [on the cover of the CD]. We are still trying and we may always be.\n\"But, it also has to do with us as a band, and how we operate, trying to stay positive, working hard, not giving up. Slow and steady wins the race\".\nSelf releasing their two previous EPs, 2002's \"Kindling\" and 2004's \"Through The Opaque Air\" (both on Stroll Music), the band has done everything themselves up to this point, booking their own shows, putting out their own records, and touring relentlessly.\nIf asked, the band will tell you that every single thing they have is the result of hard work and longevity, believing in themselves, and what they're doing \u00ad all with a sprinkle of luck and timing.\nThe band may live in Los Angeles, but they don't know anyone in the business, nor do they have any nepotism to help them out. That is why they forced themselves to get out of Los Angeles, play shows, put out their own CDs, and do everything themselves. They quickly realized that they're a one-fan-at-a-time band, and if they were going to succeed, they had to slug it out and win over critics and music fans alike one at a time.\nThus, the band motto: If you think someone owes you something or things should be handed to you, you should become an insurance salesman.\nAnd, the result is nothing short of commendable. Following the release of \"Through The Opaque Air\", the band did several tours, including a national tour (with a stop in New York for CMJ's New Music Festival), two West Coast tours, and treks through the Midwest and Southwest.\nIt is this hard-working, practical mindset that helped land them at In Music We Trust Records, a Portland, Oregon-based independent record label that heard \"Steady\" and quickly agreed to put it out.\nWhen it comes to discussing the songs on \"Steady\", the band is very hesitant to give a definite definition behind the lyrics, preferring to have their listeners submerge themselves in the songs and come to their own conclusions.\n\"Marguerite writes all the lyrics and mostly they are all about everyday life, day to day personal experiences, struggles, dreams, etc.,\" states the band. \"As with most of The Slow Signal Fade stuff, we don't like to be specific, so whoever is listening can also make their own assumptions and connections. They may think something totally different than the song is really about, and that's okay with us, too.\"\nNow that you know about \"Steady\", the band's new record, you should know a little history of The Slow Signal Fade.\nThe band consists of lead vocalist Marguerite Olivelle, who was born in Sri Lank and moved with her family to Canada, before settling in Los Angeles, where she has spent the majority of her life. Bassist Chris Walters, who was born in upstate NY (Rochester area), migrated to Los Angeles to attend U.S.C. where he studied music. Drummer Aaron Vishria, a Memphis, Tennessee native, also moved to Los Angeles to attend U.S.C. And then there is guitarist Ron Ulicny, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, before deciding to move to Los Angeles.\nTogether, the band writes and develops the songs. Absent is a dictator and egos.\nThe band's only concern is to not repeat themselves; they don't want to create songs that sound the same. They want their songs to be in their own style, and sound cohesive, but they don't want things to be cookie cutter. That is their number one goal when writing songs.\nThe band is able to pull this off by allowing each member to contribute equally, preferring to write every song as a group, rather than having someone come in with the song and tell everyone what their parts are. This allows them to have songs that are slow, fast, heavy, soft, rock, or pop.\nThe band feels this is one of the things that help them stay 'unique'; their diverse backgrounds as both musicians and people help them further explore this element of the band.\nEach member puts in their two cents from start to finish, everyone has equal say over everything, and all suggestions are welcomed and then discussed as a group. Leave your egos out of the practice space, and always do what is best for the song or the music, not what is best for just you; that's how The Slow Signal Fade lives, and writes songs.\nThe members of The Slow Signal Fade have all given up a lot in their lives to create music together and make the band function. They all realize they could be living more comfortable lives behind a desk or with a 9 to 5 job, but this is what they love and want to do. And that is why they work so hard at it.\nThe result is the band's debut full-length, \"Steady\", and best record to date.\nLook for The Slow Signal Fade to tour relentlessly throughout 2006 and into 2007, promoting \"Steady\" and winning over new fans at every stop.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T22:22:04Z", "url": "http://inmusicwetrustrecords.com/theslowsignalfade.html", "byte_size": 6908, "char_size": 6906}

Coast Cutlery Co.\nDistrict court denies motion for preliminary injunction in a false advertising action brought by manufacturer of knives, concluding that under Supreme Court eBay v.

Plaintiff Leatherman, also a manufacturer of knives, had 61 different types of Coast knives independently tested for the type of steel and hardness of the blade. The results showed that none of the tested knives were made of 440C steel and only two of the tested knives had a hardness of 57 to 59 HRC. Leatherman sued Coast for false advertising under section 43 of the Lanham Act and sought a preliminary injunction requiring Coast to issue corrective notices and prohibiting Coast from stating that its knives are made of 440C steel, are hardened to between 57 and 59 HRC, and are individually hardness tested. Since Leatherman filed the complaint and motion for preliminary injunction, Coast undertook some corrective actions. Leatherman argued that the corrective actions were insufficient.\nA party seeking a preliminary injunction, instructed the court, must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, the balance of equities tips in his favor, and an injunction is in the public interest. Although the court determined that three of the four factors \u2014 likelihood of success on the merits, balance of the equities, and the public interest \u2014 favored Leatherman, the court denied Leatherman\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction because it failed to show a likelihood of irreparable harm.\nThe court initially evaluated the strength of Leatherman\u2019s section 43(a) Lanham Act claim. To establish a section 43(a) claim, a plaintiff must establish (1) falsity in a commercial statement, (2) deception, (3) materiality, (4)interstate commerce, and (5) injury. First, the court found that Coast, through its corrective actions, indirectly admitted to falsely advertising that its products are made from 440C steel, have a hardness of 57-59 HRC, and are individually tested for hardness. Second, the court held that Coast\u2019s statements were literally false and thus are presumed to have a tendency to deceive. Third, Leatherman produced sufficient evidence to support the materiality element. A consumer comment showed that the consumer was swayed by the 440C steel description about Coast\u2019s product. In a consumer survey conducted by Coast, 17% of respondents said that a particular type of steel greatly influences their purchasing decision. Fourth, the false statements entered interstate commerce via Coast\u2019s website, product packaging, catalogs, and on the product itself. Finally, the parties merged discussion of injury as an element of a false advertising claim with the discussion of irreparable harm.\nIn light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in eBay, Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388 (2006), and the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Flexible Lifeline v. Precision Lift, Inc., 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 17462 (9th Cir. Aug. 22, 2011), the court rejected Leatherman\u2019s argument that it is entitled to a presumption of irreparable harm if a tendency to deceive has been established. In eBay, the Ninth Circuit considered a permanent injunction issued based on a finding of patent infringement, and disapproved of the use of \u201ccategorical\u201d rules with respect to irreparable harm. In Flexible Lifeline, the Ninth Circuit reversed the long standing precedent that irreparable harm may be presumed in copyright infringement cases once there is a showing of a likelihood of success on the merits. The Ninth Circuit found that eBay has broad implications (that apply equally to preliminary and permanent injunctions), and that eBay is not limited to patent infringement cases. The court noted that other jurisdictions have likewise concluded that presumptions of irreparable harm are no longer appropriate after eBay, and indicated that the First, Second, Fourth, and Eleventh Circuits have raised similar concerns over presumptions of irreparable harm.\nWithout a presumption, the court concluded that the balance of the elements of the preliminary injunction test did not tip in Leatherman\u2019s favor. Although three of the four factors considered in its preliminary injunction analysis \u2014 likelihood of success on the merits, balance of equities, and the public interest \u2014 favored Leatherman, the court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary because it failed to demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable harm.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T07:52:59Z", "url": "https://www.loeb.com/en/insights/publications/2011/10/leatherman-tool-group-inc-v-coast-cutlery-co", "byte_size": 4907, "char_size": 4871}

{"text": "After more than a year and a half without a contract, Oakland teachers are preparing to vote on a strike. But teachers frustrated with how slowly the formal bargaining process works say they want to show the district they're willing to strike. So for the second time in two months some teachers plan to call in sick en masse Friday in what they\u2019re calling a \"sickout.\"\nHayes listed grievances that ranged from the proliferation of charter schools in Oakland to the state of school facilities. He has helped organize the action and says he's heard from teachers at 10 schools who plan to take part, plus students and parents.\nThey plan to hold a rally in front of Oakland Technical High School from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and then march to the Oakland Unified School District office, where they plan to rally into the afternoon.\nIn a letter to staff sent this week, district officials reminded teachers the action is illegal, writing: \"Teachers participating in sick-outs will be subject to disciplinary action and will lose pay for time missed as these coordinated actions present significant safety and instructional problems for our students.\"\nJenine Lindsey, the district\u2019s director of labor strategy, said there\u2019s a reason state law lays out a process for resolving labor disputes.\nThe district anticipates schools will stay open and instruction will continue, with central office staff filling in. Some schools may run on modified schedules.\nThis sickout, like the last, isn't sanctioned by the teachers union, the Oakland Education Association.\n\"I understand the frustrations of our teachers,\" said OEA president Keith Brown. \"Our teachers are willing to take action for the schools that Oakland students deserve.\"\nFriday's action comes after a rally last weekend that drew hundreds of teachers, parents and labor leaders to downtown Oakland to call for increased funding for education and to protest looming budget cuts and school closures.\nWith Los Angeles teachers striking, six states have now seen educators stage walkouts to protest underfunding in the last year. It\u2019s looking increasingly likely that Oakland will be the next battleground in the national debate about how we fund public education and pay teachers.\nAs in L.A., Oakland's negotiations snagged on teacher pay and class size, among other things. The Oakland teachers union wants to see a 12 percent salary increase over three years, while the district\u2019s final offer is a 5 percent increase over three years.\n\"The pay is too low in Oakland, and the rent is very high,\" Brown said. \"It is important that our teachers have a living wage so they're able to stay in the community and give our students the support they deserve.\"\nThe average teacher salary in Oakland Unified is $63,149. That\u2019s lower than all other districts in Alameda County, though that figure doesn't account for benefits.\nWe want to hear from you. What stories should we cover?\nOakland Unified's Lindsey argues that OUSD teachers don't see benefits deducted from their paychecks, while teachers in some other districts do.\nThe showdown over pay and working conditions is playing out as budget cuts and school closures roil the district. Oakland Unified is faced with tens of millions of dollars in cuts over the next three years, and the bailout money available from the state hinges on the district showing that it\u2019s taking steps to become financially stable.\nFollow our coverage of the strikes, closures, and more.\nTo that end, Oakland Unified is looking to cut millions of dollars from next year\u2019s budget, while moving to close and merge schools. District officials estimate they need to cut down the district\u2019s footprint by 24 schools.\nAll this is aggravating the frustrations teachers already had about their working conditions.\nFor their part, district officials say they want to pay teachers more. The district has identified boosting teacher pay and settling the contract as priorities for improving teacher retention and ultimately improving student outcomes.\nGiven their budget constraints, it's a matter of coming up with the money. District officials say they\u2019re looking for places to cut, but have not given specifics.\nThe final step in the formal negotiation process is a fact-finding hearing set for Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. The union and district could reach an agreement during the hearing. If they don't, they expect a recommendation for a settlement from the fact-finding panel by mid-February. If the union rejects it, they can strike.\nBrown said he plans to announce the date of the strike vote this Sunday at an event to create posters and artwork for the possible walkout.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T08:47:23Z", "url": "https://www.kqed.org/news/11718940/teachers-strike-looming-in-oakland-anger-boils-over-into-wildcat-moves", "byte_size": 4646, "char_size": 4626}

I have to confess, however, that the majority of times I have come down here it has always been one big joke \u2014 however, perhaps the time has come when we are seeing football become something more than an underdog sport,\" he said.\nHe agreed that some fans might have been disappointed with the performance of the professionals in the Santos-Trinidad game, but he reminds these fans that conditions on that day were hardly conducive to good football.\n\"But the World Cup is something else. If we are treated fairly we will be there playing our guts out. It is unfortunate that we allowed ourselves to be trapped into playing Haiti in that 'friendly match' last year.\nI think we should have avoided it.

{"text": "\"Jack finished university three years ago, but he's still stuck in a dead-end job in a sinister call-centre in Manchester. When the beautiful (and rich) Jennifer comes into his life he thinks he has finally found his ticket out of there. Trouble is that his boss is interested in Jennifer as well, and there's something strangely bestial about him... So when Jennifer buys Fell House, a mysterious old mansion out in remote Cumbria, a house party on a legendary scale seems like the perfect escape. But as the party spins out of control on a seemingly neverending night, they must face up to the terrifying possibility that not all their guests may be human - and some of them want to feed.\"\nThe Leaping is a strange and powerful beast of a book. \"The wind wakes me up in the early hours and I confuse the present with a memory,\" it begins, and that sense of the ethereal infecting the everyday pervades Tom Fletcher's impressive debut becomes a powerful theme throughout the atmospheric narrative which follows. Three parts character study to one part fearful folktale, this is a novel that I can't help but feel has been pitched poorly. If you want out and out werewolf fiction, avert your eyes. Such audiences come seeking visceral thrills and shlocky chills, and they'll find none herein. There's nothing so cheap about The Leaping; this is sophisticated and considered fiction - remarkably so given that its author is only 24 years young. Make no mistake: there are indeed werewolves, but they're only about for a bit, and even then the beasts are addressed with ambiguity and a tangible sense of reverence. Come to the table without such expectations and you'll find a haunting novel that far exceeds the potential appeal of everyday urban fantasy.\nJack and Francis, our alternating narrators for the duration, live in student accommodation in Manchester with a gaggle of twenty-something friends, though they're no longer students - the flat is just a hangover of their collective lack of organisational skills - but co-workers at a dismal call-centre in the city. In between shifts, they drink tea incessantly, club against their better judgment, and talk books and movies to pass the time. The glue that truly binds them together, though, is Mario Kart, games of which see them all gathered around the television in the living room, racing for dear life and red shells.\nTo begin with, The Leaping reads like the antithesis of lad lit, a novel written by and indeed for the new generation of the nation: alternative, disaffected and unapologetically middle-class youth with no real notion of career or family. Down-to-earth and refreshingly direct, it certainly struck a chord with me, thanks in no small part to such relatable, if not always likeable characters. You can't help but feel for Jack as he's harassed by his creepy supervisor Kenny at the call-centre, and soon enough you'll be whooping with joy when he gets a date with a hot goth.\nJennifer isn't just your token panda-eyed pretty girl, either. She's just come into an inheritance, which she spends on a run-down old cottage in the idyllic Yorkshire fells. She's just the push Jack needs to finally move on from the going-nowhere existence he's led for an interminable number of years, and together they kick in their jobs and move into Fell House to make a go of it. Sad to see their friend move on, Jack's flatmates - one of whom nurses an inappropriate crush on Jennifer - start planning an extravagant housewarming party, but what they don't know is that there's another event in the offing nearby: The Leaping. And The Leaping is a party like no other.\nWhat all the plot synopsis in the world fails to convey about Tom Fletcher's uncanny novel, however, is the sense of dread that's palpable throughout The Leaping. Foreboding from the get-go and punctuated by utterly terrifying interludes, it might be a while before the werewolves come out of the woodwork, but when they do, two-thirds through, it's almost a relief. The suspense mounts inexorably... the feeling that something is very, very wrong builds and builds... until the curtain finally comes down - and all hell breaks loose. It makes for an incredibly satisfying moment, and though from that point on you're never quite sure what the state of play is - one can never truly know the unknowable - it's atmospheric, brutal and unrestrained.\nAlthough it is, perhaps, rather at odds with all that's come before. There's a sudden shift in the narrative that can be difficult to parse, but if you're going to enjoy The Leaping, you'll already be well and truly enraptured by the point at which it threatens to comes undone. That momentary muddle aside, with great, quirky characters and bold prose, a brilliantly British sense of humour and a last act which leaves no-one unscathed by the horrors of the fellside on a night that never ends, Tom Fletcher's debut is a powerful and progressive piece of work.\nGlad you liked this Niall :) I did wonder what you would you make of it.\nGod but that sounds magnificent.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T00:23:17Z", "url": "http://scotspec.blogspot.com/2010/06/book-review-leaping-by-tom-fletcher.html", "byte_size": 5045, "char_size": 5045}

{"text": "President Moon Jae-in\u2019s controversial ratification of inter-Korean agreements he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang last month highlights the legal and political complexities of dealing with the North. It also manifests how deep polarization in this society is.\nThe controversy began Tuesday last week when Moon ratified the Pyongyang Declaration and inter-Korean military agreement. The declaration calls for denuclearization of the peninsula and broader inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation, and the military agreement outlines measures to end hostilities between the two sides.\nCheong Wa Dae insisted the president is able to ratify the inter-Korean accords since parliamentary consent is not necessary for them because the Panmunjom Declaration reached at April\u2019s first summit between Moon and Kim -- a sort of parent agreement for the two following accords -- is going through the parliamentary ratification process. This makes little sense.\nMost of all, it is unreasonable for the government to enforce what it says are subordinate agreements to the Panmunjom Declaration while the National Assembly has yet to ratify it. It is like putting some enforcement decrees into effect before the law above is legislated and proclaimed.\nMoreover, the Pyongyang Declaration requires the National Assembly\u2019s consent because it would entail the spending of taxpayers\u2019 money. Article 60 of the Constitution says the National Assembly has the right to ratify treaties pertaining to mutual assistance or mutual security and those that incur financial obligation.\nNevertheless, the Moon government insists the Pyongyang Declaration is designed to carry out April\u2019s Panmunjom Declaration, and parliamentary ratification of the broader agreement would cover all subsidiary agreements. Then the government should have waited for the parliamentary endorsement of the parent declaration.\nThe ratification of the Pyongyang Declaration and inter-Korean military agreement exposed another aspect of self-contradiction on the part of the government.\nThen Moon and the officials need to answer this question: Why did the government ask the National Assembly to ratify the Panmunjom Declaration? The legality or sovereignty of the northern part of the peninsula is not an issue that can be determined by political expediency.\nThe episode involving Moon\u2019s autobiography also illustrates the dilemma his government is in. In \u201cDestiny,\u201d which he published in 2011, Moon wrote that agreements made by the leaders of the two Koreas should be regarded as treaties between states.\nIndeed, what kind of legal status North Korea should have in the South Korean legal code is a complicated issue. A majority of South Koreans advocate the current Constitution that regards North Korea as a part of South Korea only because contrary stipulation may mean acceptance of perpetual national division.\nIn reality, however, it is difficult to deny North Korea\u2019s statehood. North Korea is already a full member of the United Nations and few in the world believe it actually belongs to the South. The question about the statehood of North Korea may not be solved until the two Koreas achieve unity.\nAmid all these controversies, the Moon government published the Pyongyang Declaration in the government gazette Monday in the final step for putting it into effect. But the presidential action faces a judiciary review as the opposition Liberty Korea Party filed in the same day a court injunction to suspend its enforcement.\nIt is not the first time the government and opposition have engaged in legal battles over domestic political issues or North Korean affairs. But the latest case shows how difficult it is to forge national consensus or bipartisan cooperation on North Korea policy.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T12:23:30Z", "url": "http://khnews.kheraldm.com/view.php?ud=20181029000335", "byte_size": 3789, "char_size": 3771}

{"text": "Not to be confused with Subsidiary or subsidy.\nThis article is about the general principle of subsidiarity, with particular reference to European Union law. For the Catholic social teaching, see Subsidiarity (Catholicism).\nSubsidiarity is perhaps presently best known as a general principle of European Union law.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines subsidiarity as \"the principle that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level\". The concept is applicable in the fields of government, political science, neuropsychology, cybernetics, management and in military command (mission command). Subsidiarity is a general principle of European Union law. In the United States of America, the principle of States' Rights is enshrined in the constitution. Although the principle is older, its expression in the term \"subsidiarity\" was first coined in 1891 by the Roman Catholic Church for its social teaching.\nThe OED adds that the term \"subsidiarity\" in English follows the early German usage of \"Subsidiarit\u00e4t\".  More distantly, it is derived from the Latin verb subsidio (to aid or help), and the related noun subsidium (aid or assistance). The concept as discussed here was first described formally in Catholic social teaching. Coupled with another Christian democratic principle, sphere sovereignty, subsidiarity is said to have led to the creation of corporatist welfare states throughout the world.\nAlexis de Tocqueville's classic study, Democracy in America, may be viewed as an examination of the operation of the principle of subsidiarity in early 19th century America. De Tocqueville noted that the French Revolution began with \"a push towards decentralization ... in the end, an extension of centralization\". He wrote that \"Decentralization has, not only an administrative value, but also a civic dimension, since it increases the opportunities for citizens to take interest in public affairs; it makes them get accustomed to using freedom. And from the accumulation of these local, active, persnickety freedoms, is born the most efficient counterweight against the claims of the central government, even if it were supported by an impersonal, collective will.\"\nAs Christian Democratic political parties were formed, they adopted the Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity, as well as the neo-Calvinist theological teaching of sphere sovereignty, with both Protestants and Roman Catholics agreeing \"that the principles of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity boiled down to the same thing\".\nWill the American people never learn that, as a principle, to expect swift response and efficiency from government is fatuous? Will we never heed the principle of subsidiarity (in which our fathers were bred), namely that no public agency should do what a private agency can do better, and that no higher-level public agency should attempt to do what a lower-level agency can do better \u2013 that to the degree the principle of subsidiarity is violated, first local government, the state government, and then federal government wax in inefficiency? Moreover, the more powers that are invested in government, and the more powers that are wielded by government, the less well does government discharge its primary responsibilities, which are (1) defence of the commonwealth, (2) protection of the rights of citizens, and (3) support of just order.\nDecentralization, or decentralising governance, refers to the restructuring or reorganisation of authority so that there is a system of co-responsibility between institutions of governance at the central, regional and local levels according to the principle of subsidiarity, thus increasing the overall quality and effectiveness of the system of governance, while increasing the authority and capacities of sub-national levels.\nSystemic failures of the type seen in the crash of 2007/08 can largely be avoided, since diverse solutions to common problems avoid common mode failure.\nIndividual and group initiative is given maximum scope to solve problems.\nThe systemic problem of moral hazard is largely avoided. In particular, the vexing problem of atrophied local initiative/responsibility is avoided.\nWhen a genuine principle of liberty is recognised by a higher political entity but not all subsidiary entities, implementation of that principle can be delayed at the more local level.\nWhen a genuinely efficacious economic principle is recognised by a higher political entity, but not all subsidiary entities, implementation of that principle can be delayed at the more local level.\nIn areas where the local use of common resources has a broad regional, or even global, impact (such as in the generation of pollutants), higher levels of authority may have a natural mandate to supersede local authority.\nSubsidiarity is perhaps presently best known as a general principle of European Union law. According to this principle, the EU may only act (i.e. make laws) where action of individual countries is insufficient. The principle was established in the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht. However, at the local level it was already a key element of the European Charter of Local Self-Government, an instrument of the Council of Europe promulgated in 1985 (see Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the Charter) (which states that the exercise of public responsibilities should be decentralised). Subsidiarity is related in essence to, but should not be confused with, the concept of a margin of appreciation.\nA more descriptive analysis of the principle can be found in Protocol 2 to the European Treaties.\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg is the authority that has to decide whether a regulation falls within the exclusive competence[a] of the Union, as defined by the Treaty of European Union and its predecessors. As the concept of subsidiarity has a political as well as a legal dimension, the Court of Justice has a reserved attitude toward judging whether EU legislation is consistent with the concept. The Court will examine only marginally whether the principle is fulfilled. A detailed explanation of the legislation is not required; it is enough that the EU institutions explain why national legislation seems inadequate and that Union law has an added value.\nFurthermore, in the fifth recital the Parliament and the Council stated that the action taken by the Member States in response to the Commission's Recommendation has not fully achieved the desired result. The Community legislature therefore found that the objective of its action could not be achieved sufficiently by the Member States.\nConsequently, it is apparent that, on any view, the Parliament and the Council did explain why they considered that their action was in conformity with the principle of subsidiarity and, accordingly, that they complied with the obligation to give reasons as required under Article 190 of the Treaty. An express reference to that principle cannot be required.\n^ Oxford English Dictionary. https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/subsidiarity Definition: \"[mass noun] (in politics) the principle that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level:\"\n^ Early German usage: Subsidiarit\u00e4t(1809 or earlier in legal use; 1931 in the context of Catholic social doctrine, in \u00a780 of Rundschreiben \u00fcber die gesellschaftliche Ordnung (\"Encyclical concerning the societal order\"), the German version of Pope Pius XI's encyclical Quadragesimo anno (1931))\".\n^ \"Das Subsidiarit\u00e4tsprinzip als wirtschaftliches Ordnungsprinzip\", Wirtschaftliche Entwicklung und soziale Ordnung.

{"text": "For much of the last decade, Apple has been consolidating its control over the chips embedded in its products to support graphics, machine learning and other tasks. Inside some of its latest iPhones is another custom chip, a new main power management IC (PMIC) that Apple designed to prolong battery life. Dialog Semiconductor had until recently been selling Apple that part.\nThe importance of this tiny component came through on Thursday. As part of a $600 million deal, Dialog said it would license the main PMIC technology it developed for the iPhone and transfer around 300 chip engineers to Apple. The company said that the deal allowed it to continue selling main PMICs to other customers and in other markets like the Internet of Things.\nApple is technically paying $300 million in the transaction, which includes patents and licenses from Dialog. The other $300 million is a prepayment for other products to be shipped to Apple within the next three years. Most of the 300 employees being transferred in the deal\u2014which account for around 16 percent of Dialog's total workforce\u2014were already working on chips specifically for Apple products.\nOn Thursday, Dialog also announced that it had signed new contracts with Apple to supply power management, audio subsystem, charging and mixed-signal integrated circuits. The company, whose shares increased 25 percent following the news, said that it would start earning revenue from the new contracts next year. Another part of the deal: Apple will take over four Dialog offices in Italy, Germany and Britain.\nThe deal not only removes the uncertainty around Dialog\u2019s relationship with Apple. It could also bolster the company\u2019s attempts to reduce its dependence on Apple. That means expanding its presence in markets like the Internet of Things, which includes smart home appliances and smart watches. The company expects its advanced mixed-signal, connectivity, automotive and industrial businesses to grow between 10 and 15 percent from 2018 to 2022.\n\u201cWe believe that this transaction is in the best interests of our employees and shareholders who will benefit from a business with enhanced focus, strong growth prospects and additional financial flexibility to invest in strategic growth initiatives,\u201d said Jalal Bagherli, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, in a statement. \u201cGoing forward, we will have a clear strategic focus,\u201d he added.\nSupplying chips for hundreds of millions of iPhones and other Apple products every year can fundamentally change a company\u2019s fortunes. But the sudden loss of that business can have catastrophic results. Over the last decade, Apple has been ramping up the development of custom chips for tasks like image processing and machine learning. The company introduced its first ARM-based SoC for the iPhone and iPad in 2010.\nThe potential dangers were underlined when Imagination Technologies announced last year that Apple would remove its graphics processing units (GPUs) from the iPhone\u2019s core chipset for the first time in a decade. Apple developed a homegrown GPU architecture in its place to improve realism of reflected light and other graphics. The move eliminated a significant amount of Imagination\u2019s business, which has been split up and sold off.\nApple deployed the same strategy with Dialog, which will continue selling main power management products to the Cupertino, California-based company before they are gradually scooped out of the iPhone and Apple's other hardware starting in 2019. Bagherli said that the company would continue supplying Apple with current and future generations of another power management chip, the sub-PMIC.\nBefore Thursday\u2019s announcement, Dialog's market value had been cleaved in half over the last year amid warnings that Apple would develop custom power management chips. For much of the last year, Bagherli has struggled to tamp down concerns about its business. In June, the company acknowledged that Apple was adding another source for its PMIC components. That caused Dialog to lower its projected 2018 sales by around five percent.\nDialog said that the deal would not reduce this year\u2019s revenue. But the company will not take home any revenue from the main PMIC components inside the 2019 iPhone or the 2020 iPad and Apple Watch. Revenue from the licensing deal with Apple is estimated to be $875 million in 2018. But it will decline in the second half of next year, phasing out by 2022. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019.\nFollowing the deal, the company\u2019s headcount will decline to around 1,800. Its sub-PMIC business with Apple, on target for $150 million before the end of the year, is projected to increase to around $450 million by 2022. Dialog expects Apple to account for between 35 and 40 percent of its 2022 revenues, down from an estimated 75 percent this year, the company said.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T20:40:36Z", "url": "https://www.electronicdesign.com/embedded-revolution/apple-takes-over-part-dialog-semiconductor-600-million-deal", "byte_size": 4880, "char_size": 4850}

{"text": "\u00a9 Copyright 2018 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Study Design. An experimental study. Objective. This study aimed to investigate task-dependent changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) within the spinal cord during painful stimulation. Summary of Background Data. Earlier experiments by Mandl et al (2008, 2013) used non-invasive functional diffusion tensor imaging (fDTI) to detect white matter fibers that were active during functional tasks. In two studies, it was observed that FA of involved white matter tracts exhibited repeatable task-related increases. In this study, we attempted to extend the fDTI work in the spinal cord. Methods. Twenty-three healthy, right-handed men (mean age 22 yrs, standard deviation [SD]=4) were invited to participate in this study. Diffusion-weighted images were collected over spinal levels C2 to T4 during a painful thermal stimulus applied to the left thenar eminence. In order to investigate task-related activity, FA values within the contralateral (right) spinothalamic tract were analyzed using a generalized estimating equations (GEE) procedure. As a control, we also examined activity in the ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal tracts, which are not considered to be involved in nociception. Results. Significant task-related decreases in FA were observed in the right spinothalamic tract at vertebral levels C2-C5 (Wald X 2 (1)=17.754, P<0.001). There was no change in control regions at levels C7-T2 of the same tract, which are located below the level of input from dermatome C6, Wald X 2 (1)=0.185, P=0.667. Results in all other regions assessed, that is, the left spinothalamic tract and bilateral corticospinal tract, were also not significant (P>0.05). Conclusion. The current findings suggest that task-related changes in FA associated with the transmission of pain signals along the spinal cord can be detected using fDTI. We observed decreased FA values in the contralateral (right) spinothalamic tract following painful stimulation, while no such activity was apparent in control regions.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T00:09:01Z", "url": "http://scholars.uab.edu/display/pub1554077", "byte_size": 2076, "char_size": 2075}

I believe in what the protesters marched for and I selfishly made the choice not to attend.\nI did have a really fun family day, with swimming and playing with dolls with my daughter. I play with dolls more than most adults should\u2026 I loved yesterday. However, there were more important issues at hand. I should have joined my fellow Hong Kongers on the street and I won\u2019t make that mistake again.\nWe have recently seen the power of the people in Hong Kong, with a group called Scholarism, that forced the Education Bureau to back down over it\u2019s planned national education curriculum in 2012, and this group is once again a major player in this fight for democracy.\nIt will be very interesting what happens with this and the OccupyCentral campaign. It seems that we have a big fight on our hands, and I for one feel very appreciative of the thousands of people who stood up on our behalf yesterday.\nHow about you? Did you attend the protest? If so, how was it? If not, do you regret not doing so?\nI was listening, today, to an in depth commentary on what was happening in HK; love NPR, very informative. If I had been in HK I most surely would have joined in and protested. What China is trying to do, albeit with some semblance of subtlety, is turn HK into another one of its puppet-states. I think this is an outrage and it would break my heart to see anything change what HK is.\nI wish, as I am sure many in HK do, that it were still in British hands. China is just the worst type of government imaginable; as long as those at the top reap rewards, to hell with the rest. China does not have the capacity to treasure the Pearl that it is in possession of with HK.\nI truly feel that everyone in HK has to continuously be on gaurd and ready to speak out/ protest so as to never seem complacent, that would be a grievous error and China will take any form of complacency as acceptance of their policies.\nTo everyone in HK I have to say \u201cBon courage!\u201d Stay strong and do not accept anything less than what already is.

{"text": "Linda and I had planned to visit Louisville for her Mom's birthday on the weekend of March 12. Since we would be running anyway Linda thought a \u201cgroup\u201d run in Louisville would be nice. As it turned out the group she chose numbered 7953 plus the two of us, and it had a name: \u201cRodes City Run 10k\u201d (www.rodescityrun.com).\nThis race is ranked the 13th largest 10k in the nation according to the 2009 USATF rankings and it was bigger than any event I had ever participated in. No big deal for Linda who has run 20+ marathons including Chicago and Boston. We are definitely not in 10k race shape as we are doing a slow progression in training for Chicago in October. With this in mind we decided the proper \u201cmind set\u201d was to take \u201cRodes City\u201d as low-key tempo run. A non-conversational pace but definitely not \u201crace\u201d pace. Though technically a race, we would be in a mob of people that we didn\u2019t know so we both found this to be a realistic endeavor. No familiar age group faces, no King/Queen competition, just get in a rhythm, run fast, stay relaxed and enjoy the atmosphere.\nTo help avoid slipping into the race day mind set we dressed in our typical daily run attire. We skipped any pre-race warm up, strides or stretching. Well, actually we had a semi-warm up \u2013 a jog to the port-a-johns and back to the start area. Not much of a warm up as the port-a-john lines were long and the temperature was a cool 45\u00b0, so any real warm up occurred after the run began.\nThe start area was sardine style \u2013 packed!! Announcements were made but I couldn\u2019t hear anything but crowd noise. I did hear a start horn and then a minute or so later I began to move/walk with the flow of the crowd toward the start \u2013 thankfully chip timing was being used. Once across the start mat it was still a half-mile later before I felt like I had my own semblance of running space. I was able to establish a nice \u201cnot too fast, not too slow\u201d rhythm and settled in to enjoy the opportunity. New ups, new downs, and new turns, a new experience and Linda and I both had fun!! Shortly after I finished Linda came in and we headed to the Panera tent for a bagel. Our times exceeded expectations without ever getting into the race mode \u2013 so we were pleased.\nThe course was point to point so after a jog cool down back to the car our \u201cRode\u201d fun run adventure in Louisville was concluded.\nNext up is Mark Skelton\u2019s Phipps Bend 10 miler. Another fun run and as Mark says, there is only ONE hill.

{"text": "I have discussed previously the locomotive assignment booklets used for a number of years by Southern Pacific, and commented about how to use such a booklet for choosing my 1953 locomotives to model (you can see it at: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2011/04/choosing-1953-locomotive-roster.html ). But I didn\u2019t say much in that post about the assignment booklets themselves. I want to say more in this post.\nShown below is the cover of a typical booklet, this one for March 31, 1950. These were issued quarterly, and naturally describe all locomotives on the Pacific Lines part of the SP system (the summary shows system-wide totals for all Pacific Lines divisions). You can click on the image to enlarge it.\nWithin the booklet, each division had a separate listing. I show below the two pages for the Coast Division, which is the division within which my layout is sited. Of course this division extended far beyond the area I model, from Santa Barbara in the south, to San Francisco, and thus included the entire Peninsula commuter district (at that time, spanning San Francisco-San Jose). Here is page 11 of the March 31, 1950 booklet.\nNote here that at this time there were 13 diesel switchers and 26 steam switchers, along with nine Consolidations and a Mogul also assigned to yard service, to do the division\u2019s switching. In addition to large yards at Bayshore and Santa Clara, division point yards at Watsonville Junction, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara had to be worked.\nThe second page, page 12 of the booklet, shows the remaining engines.\nIt is interesting, looking at these two pages, to see the large number of Consolidations, and the relatively small number of cab-forwards at this time, and only five A-B-B-A sets of F units. That would change as dieselization proceeded, because the new F units were preferentially assigned at first in desert and mountain regions, where their tractive effort and absence of water consumption made them big advances over steam power. Meanwhile, the displaced steam gradually migrated into California on the lesser gradient areas, including Coast Division.\nCommute service on this division accounts for the substantial number of Pacifics, Mountains and GS 4-8-4s on the roster, relative to most other SP divisions at the time.\nI have chosen my locomotive numbers from these assignments, combined with examination of yard and roundhouse photos at San Luis Obispo, the nearest locomotive facility to my layout\u2019s mythical Santa Rosalia Branch. Among the Consolidations listed on page 11, you can see numbers 2592, 2752, and 2829, all of which are on my layout. I also have an S-2 diesel switcher no. 1389, which as you can see was also on this division. The booklet shown above is for 1950, but in 1953 these same engines were still at San Luis Obispo.\nI discussed these same issues, and showed a San Luis roundhouse photo, in the post cited at the top of this post, along with showing a 1952 locomotive assignment sheet. One of the truly distinctive locomotives assigned for years at San Luis Obispo was Consolidation 2592. In the last years of its active life, it had a \u201cwhaleback\u201d tender inherited from an early cab-forward. Here is one view of the engine switching at San Luis Obispo, taken in January 1954 by Rod Crossley. Note that the road name on the side of the tender is smaller than was standard after 1946.\nThis locomotive is Class C-9, built by Baldwin in 1906, and like many Harriman Consolidations, so useful that it remained in service when newer and more modern engines were going to scrap.\nHere is my model of SP 2592, switching on my layout at Ballard. This model combines a Key brass SP 2-8-0 with a Westside brass tender, making this a distinctive locomotive. Today it also has DCC and sound, thanks to Al Massi.\nThis single locomotive example illustrates one way to use the assignment sheets, combined with photographic evidence of how locomotives were configured and even lettered, to provide a realistic part of a layout locomotive fleet.\nI have written several times about the variety of commodities carried in tank cars, and the fact that certain commodities required special cars. Of course, many edible products and many simple chemicals can be carried in general-service tank cars, AAR class TM and ICC class 103, or even in non-regulated tank cars of classes like AAR-201 and AAR-203. But many corrosive, flammable, dangerous, or poisonous commodities have regulatory limits to how they are shipped, and must be carried in certain types of tank cars suitable for those cargoes.\nA fairly complete table, occupying 14 book pages, was issued by American Car & Foundry, and was published as an Appendix to Edward S. Kaminski\u2019s book, Tank Cars, American Car & Foundry, 1865 to 1955 (Signature Press, Berkeley, 2003). But of course not everyone has that book on their shelf, even though as a partner in the publisher, I think they surely ought to own the book <grin>.\nA comparable table was published and distributed by General American Transportation Corporation, in several editions over the years. I have a copy of the one published in 1961. It is a most informative document, filled with operating directions, general arrangement drawings for complete cars, and also detail drawings of specific parts. Here is the cover (a little worn with use).\nAnyone can download the PDF for their use, or print it if desired.\nIn an upcoming column in the \u201cGetting Real\u201d column series in Model Railroad Hobbyist, I will be discussing tank car construction and details, as well as usage, and this commodity table will be one of the tools to identify cars with cargoes.\nIt\u2019s my hope that this table will be use to modelers who wish to correctly marry their tank car models with appropriate waybills for suitable cargoes. That is the main way I use either one of the two tables (from AC&F or General American), and there are only a few differences in detail between the two.\nAmong the refrigerator car owners from which Pacific Fruit Express borrowed cars during the PFE peak harvest months was Fruit Growers Express. These borrowed reefers could be any available cars from the entire FGEX fleet, including associated fleets from the Burlington (BREX) and Great Northern (WFEX), fleets which were operated by Fruit Growers as fully part of the FGEX fleet. For this reason, I need to model some of these cars. I already have on my roster a steel BREX car and wood-sheathed cars from WFEX and FGEX. But I could use one or two more.\nA number of years ago, at a swap meet, I saw a fairly nicely assembled reefer from a Red Ball kit (or I believe that was the origin), for one of the Pennsylvania Railroad R7 refrigerators. It had been painted in a layout owner\u2019s paint scheme of white sides with a horizontal blue frame stripe, but didn\u2019t look too bad otherwise. The price was right, just one dollar as I recall, so I bought it.\nI knew that when the PRR had joined Fruit Growers in the 1920s, the existing R7 cars had been transferred to FGE ownership. This car, as many know, was the refrigerator version of the X23 box car, with a complex pressed-steel exterior frame, built starting in 1913. This makes the exterior of the R7 visually striking, and I thought this would be an interesting addition to my FGEX fleet.\nI should quickly interject that I know perfectly well this model falls far short of the beautiful Westerfield kit for these cars (kit 1160x, with the \u201cx\u201d being a number for three different roof versions available), and these are in stock as far as I know (you can check availability on their website, at http://www.westerfieldmodels.com/ ). But this is not a central part of my reefer fleet, so I\u2019m willing to accept the compromises of this version. You may of course reach the opposite conclusion for your fleet.\nIt was easy to mask the boxcar red roof and ends and repaint the sides a golden yellow, as Fruit Growers used. Lettering was the next challenge. Although I am not aware of a decal sheet exactly for these R7 cars, the excellent Speedwitch Media set D119.1, for 1948-era paint, looked like it would work. These cars had been put into the FGEX number series 43500\u201346999, and even in the 1950s, some of these cars soldiered on in Fruit Growers service. Below is a prototype photo, taken in Sioux City, Iowa on September 30, 1952 (from the Bob\u2019s Photo collection, used with permission). The car at left is notably taller. The R7 car height was not unusual in 1913, but cars gradually got taller and taller in the ensuing 50 years, up to my modeling year of 1953.\nI chose a car number within the series noted above, and applied the decals, then weathered the model to suggest a car with lengthy service since it was last painted. In the photo below, notice how much shorter the car is, compared to the PFE steel reefer to its left, just like the photo above.\nIn service, these cars were limited by their small interior height and lack of floor racks, plus relatively thin insulation. They were accordingly used for dense cargoes like potatoes, or cargoes not requiring low transit temperatures, such as onions. I will waybill them accordingly on my layout, and am pleased to have one of these distinctive cars in my freight car fleet.\nMost of us have a stash of kits and materials, sometimes impressively large (I\u2019ve known modelers whose stash rivaled a small hobby shop), others much less so. And most of us know that an awful lot of the stuff is not going to get built or the materials used. That\u2019s more obvious with a huge stash, where a program of building at a rate of a kit a week might require a decade or more at that rate to make a sizable dent in the total. But even a smaller stash may contain a fair amount of stuff that no longer fits your needs or interests.\nI should say right away that I have no problem with kit collectors. I have known some, and was truly impressed with their encyclopedic knowledge of kit manufacturers and history. But sometimes you are surprised when you run into one. I once bought a couple of Authenticast slag car kits in a convention sales room, and when I let slip that I was looking forward to building them, the seller practically tried to grab them back from me. \u201cBuild them . . .\u201d he said in dismay. I got out of there as fast as I could (by the way, they still aren\u2019t built, as the smelter I once contemplated hasn\u2019t materialized). But really, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not a collector.\nHere\u2019s a photo of what these kits look like.\nBut when I say I\u2019m not a collector, what I mean is that I really intend (at the time) to build or use the stuff I buy, though I will concede that some of my purchases have been with the thought that someday I might need that item. And we have all learned in our years in the hobby that if in doubt, buy it. It will likely cease to be available, either out of production or the kit maker out of business or something else. Buy it now or regret it later, the saying goes. I have certainly followed that injunction in some cases.\nNaturally many of those purchases, made with the best of intentions, somehow slip out of contention for building or use, like my slag cars. And certainly freight car kits, of which I once had a truly serious stash, can pile up on you in the most unnerving fashion. The question is how you evaluate this. Maybe you are turning into a collector and haven\u2019t realized it yet. A clue is when you really like owning \u201cthat kit\u201d or \u201cthat brass engine\u201d but have no interest in building or painting it, and certainly no interest in selling it. Nothing wrong with that, though I do advocate facing up to the reality that is right under your nose.\nOr maybe you have just let things get out of hand. You know perfectly well that some of those kits were bought with objectives in mind that are no longer operative. I used to pick up structure kits all the time, when I lived in Pittsburgh and my layout had several sizable areas which were undefined, and thus could conceivably host any one of a number of structures. Now those areas are far distant in the rear-view mirror, and the kits, though still kind of nice, are clearly surplus. And there were plenty of freight car kits on my shelf which, when I looked at them objectively, really were not needed for my freight car fleet nor were sufficiently \u201cfun\u201d just to build. That makes \u2019em surplus.\nI have written in earlier posts about the gradual change in my freight car fleet, with the disposal of older models as well as unneeded kits (for example: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2014/12/a-right-size-freight-car-fleet.html ). The process continues. I never planned to replace the older models which were the best I could do at that time (remember when Athearn \u201cBlue Box\u201d box cars were the starting point for all 40-foot steel box cars?), but that\u2019s what has been happening over the last two decades. I have now disposed of close to 350 cars, in the form of kits and of older, complete models, and have acquired or built about 275 new cars, in kit or ready-to-run form. The net effect has been to reduce my stash of car kits substantially. Resin in particular has been addressed very thoroughly, with more than 125 resin car kits either built or sold.\nOne good effect of car kits of various kinds passing through my hands is that in many cases I have made a Xerox copy of kit instructions to keep, as the information can be pretty valuable in itself, not only the prototype data but model-building techniques. I even like to look at the instructions for kits owned for a long time, as a reminder of what I once wanted to do, and that can refresh some of my present planning. So even keeping your stuff moving can leave you with something of value.\nPractically every modeler has a stash of some kind, whether it\u2019s structure or car kits like I discussed above, or brass engines that you \u201cmight need,\u201d or materials like brick paper or basswood sheet or flat brass wire or . . . you recognize the pattern. This can be an asset when you need something out of that collection, but may need to be dealt with when it starts to overflow the storage space \u2014 or overflow what you are comfortable holding on to. It just needs to be evaluated from time to time.\nOver the years, I have accumulated a few older models that continue to serve as \u201cmainline\u201d freight cars, that is, cars which normally do not get switched to or from my on-layout industries, but simply pass by in the mainline freight trains (this was discussed in the last paragraph of this post: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2010/12/upgrading-old-models-3.html ). Some of these have older trucks I had never bothered to replace, and recently I got to looking at a few of them and decided they needed to be upgraded. If nothing else, this can be seen as a response in accord with my freight car standards (see for example: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2011/03/model-freight-car-standards.html ), but also reflects problems like oversize flanges, out-of-tram truck behavior, or other operational issues.\nAs an example, I will use a Mantua reefer. Minimal upgrading had been done to it, retaining its molded-on grab irons and sill steps, but with a reasonable paint and lettering job, as well as weathering. I have been working on some other \u201cmainline\u201d cars also needing new trucks, including some old tank car models and two Athearn metal house cars, but will just describe the Mantua example.\nShown above is the car body, prepared as described. Notice the route card, located right outside the black rectangle identified as the location for such cards. This card location is often seen in photos, no doubt deliberately done by car clerks who didn\u2019t wish to be dictated to. The car is intended to represent the MDT cars with steel ends and wood-sheathed sides built in 1941.\nThe problem with the trucks can be seen in the view below. The Mantua truck is assembled as two cast metal sideframes, with a sheet steel bolster inserted into each sideframe. The sharp \u201ccookie cutter\u201d wheel flanges are an artifact of the 1950s. You can click to enlarge.\nI first tried to disassemble the truck so the wheelsets could be replaced, but could not separate the parts. Also, I could see that the axle ends of the Mantua wheelsets are very narrow, so that the sideframes would not readily accept modern wheelsets. I decided to just replace the entire truck.\nThe original truck screws are very short and work only with the sheet-metal bolster shown above, so I simply tapped the hole deeper with a 2-56 tap, and chose new screws.\nOne can of course apply a generic AAR truck to cars like this. However, there are plentiful resources in existence to provide prototype information. In the case of MDT, the book Merchants Despatch, by Roger C. Hinman (Signature Press, 2011) is the relevant example, and I examined a number of photos in the book to choose a suitable truck for this model. I ended up using the Tahoe Model Works truck TMW-106, an ARA sideframe design with spring planks, produced by Buckeye.\nThe kind of job shown above on the Mantua reefer is almost trivial, except that it brings another car into conformance with standards, and also makes for better operation, when the oversize flanges of the Mantua wheelsets are replaced. In actuality, this kind of task goes on all the time with my fleet, and I only mention this instance here to use it as an example of the process.\nI\u2019ve just returned from a visit to Cuba on a licensed \u201cPeople to People\u201d tour, and there were plenty of interesting aspects to the trip, but here I will just write about the railroad and modeling aspects of interest.\nFirst, a little history. Cuba developed a rail network very early, plenty of it to serve sugar mills and plantations, but plenty more to connect cities. By 1958, Cuba had the most rail mileage per square mile of any country in the world. After the 1959 revolution, the existing railway companies were nationalized as Ferrocarriles Nationales de Cuba, which they remain today. An unfortunate aspect of a single national railway entity on an island is that there is no need to letter the name or even the initials of the owner on any equipment; there is no interchange. Rolling stock thus has a rather bare look, often bearing only a number and some very minor dimensional data.\nThe FC, as it\u2019s often designated, dieselized its main lines in the 1960s, and sugar operations gradually followed suit, eliminating steam on even the most backward plantations by about 2000. But many small steam locomotives have been preserved, and a few restored for tourism. Because of the U.S. embargo, new locomotives and rolling stock have been purchased elsewhere throughout the world, from the Soviet Union and China, to France, Germany, Britain and countries in eastern Europe, and in recent years, even freight cars from Iran. The resulting fleet is polyglot, to say the least.\nI will only show a few photos, and apologize in advance for not knowing more about the prototypes. I searched a number of Cuban bookstores for locomotive or train books, and found almost nothing. The internet coverage is spotty and sometimes contradictory. I hope anyone with a more substantial knowledge of the subject can help. But these are only intended as illustrations.\nIn Camaguey, the old railway station is terribly decrepit, though restoration is in progress, and a small replacement depot was very crowded. I was able to watch and photograph from trackside considerable switching activity, including adding cars to a departing passenger train, without attracting the least attention. Here is one of the Russian-built locomotives, no. 81001, I believe type TEM2, of which I saw several on our trip, in the red and yellow scheme which seems to be for freight power. These things sound a lot like Alcos.\nThe passenger power largely seemed to have an attractive scheme of dark and light blue. Passenger rolling stock ranged from stainless cars built by Budd, to very run-down standard steel coaches, to newer center-entrance cars looking much like box cars, and apparently built new that way. Note over the door the initials FC, not visible on many cars or locomotives.\nThe Chinese company, formerly called China North Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry (CNR) sold a fair number of locomotives to Cuba, and if I correctly understood the halting English of a trainman standing alongside one of them at Camaguey, they are hard to keep running.\nIn a couple of places there were switchers in a pleasant orange and gray scheme, like no. 38063 here, but I have not been able to find out where they were built. It was picking up this head-end car.\nBut enough about rolling stock I didn\u2019t understand very well. The most stunning thing about Cuba, speaking as a modeler, is that walking in every city is like being in a 1950s movie. New American cars stopped arriving in Cuba in 1959, so there are 1950s American cars just everywhere. I knew they were there, but really had no idea how prevalent they are: they are not exceptions, they are the dominant car on the street. And even cars from the late 1930s and the 1940s can be seen too. I will only show a few of the many photos I took, and I can tell you, I plan to duplicate some of these models (though not the colors) on my 1953 layout.\nMany of the restored cars have been repainted in brilliant colors, and few have that many original mechanical parts. Suspensions are visibly altered, almost every car has modern wheels, and I was told that engines are rarely original (as was often evident from the sound). Many Russian and European parts have kept the cars running, and even homemade parts are used, attempting to replicate the unavailable American originals. There are lots of convertibles, partly because many of the cars are in use as privately-owned taxis, but there are also \u201cclassic car club\u201d stickers on many cars. Owners are usually very proud of their car, and most speak English and are delighted to speak to an American.\nI am interested in correct model years, partly for modeling reasons, but I found car-spotting in Cuba to be a challenge. Not only may such spotting features as chrome trim as well as tail lights and other items be missing or replaced, even major visuals like grilles may be swapped. I saw an early 1950s Chevrolet with an unmistakable Buick grille, and a 1940s Ford with a unique homemade grille. This makes one a little cautious about identification of an individual car. So I will just show a few of the photos I liked. The massed taxis at places like the Parque Centrale in Havana are one good illustration, of the variety, the frequency of convertibles, and the bright replacement colors.\nAnother street scene in Havana found my wife Mary alongside what I think is a 1951 Chevy sedan, clearly with replacement paint though otherwise looking more original than most. But like nearly every car, hub caps have vanished over the years.\nHere are a couple more that I really liked seeing, first a handsome 1955 Ford at a cafe on the road heading for Havana.\nLast, a superb Studebaker on the main square in Cienfuegos, I think a 1951. We also saw Edsels, International and Dodge pickups, and many more . . . but I digress.\nYou can see that it was a visually interesting trip, and of course fascinating in many other ways too, most enjoyable for us both.\nI have alluded in prior posts in the \u201cWaybills\u201d series to the extremely valuable publications issued by many (maybe most) railroads, called a Shipper\u2019s Guide, Industrial Directory, List of Industries, or some similar title. These documents list all on-line shippers and receivers, and are obviously superb resources. These are quite rare in the field of railroad paper items, in original form, and tend to be hard to find, even at railroad museums and archives, but luckily a number have been reprinted in recent years for modelers\u2019 use. I am using reprinted Shipper Guides from Ted Schnepf\u2019s \u201cRails Unlimited\u201d business, for Great Northern, D&RGW, Union Pacific, Mopac / T&P, and Milwaukee Road. All these except the D&RGW one are available through Rails Unlimited (and here\u2019s a link to their website: http://railsunlimited.ribbonrail.com/Books/shippers.html ; click on Books). There are several posts in which I have commented about these documents (for example, this one: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2012/02/waybills-18-resources.html ).\nInside are 258 pages packed with irreplaceable information about both shippers and consignees throughout the sprawling Rock Island system. I will just show a single page to illustrate the kind of information presented. You can click on the image to enlarge it.\nThe information is self-explanatory except for the far-right column, headed \u201cSWG\u201d (for \u201cswitching\u201d), which shows whether sidings are accessible by reciprocal switching arrangements (called \u201copen\u201d) or not (\u201cclosed\u201d). The five towns listed, each in a different state, are evidently small and have only a few industries each. By contrast, cities like Houston, Kansas City, Denver, or Minneapolis require dozens of pages to list all industrial customers.\nIn fact, this 1971 Rock Island Directory is so comprehensive, it now joins my Great Northern Guide (also from Rails Unlimited) as my favorite useful and wide-ranging source of traffic information.\nThere is another source of this kind of information about shippers and consignees, namely the large list compiled by the OpSIG group (Operations SIG of NMRA), which is available at their website, www.opsig.org, under \u201cOnline Resources,\u201d and then \u201cIndustry Database.\u201d This collected information is a fine effort by OpSIG and continues to grow, but be careful, as it is for a wide range of eras. Usually the date for each entry is shown, so it is possible to choose only the ones that fit your era. And though very extensive, it is in general less complete for a specific place than a Shipper Guide.\nIn place of the process just describe, one can of course \u201cimagineer\u201d company names for either consignees or shippers if desired, but I like to find authentic ones where possible, partly because the \u201creal names\u201d often sound particularly realistic, as in this case. I cannot praise enough the value of a Shipper Guide in assisting you in that process, should you wish to work in that direction.\nSeveral years ago, I posted some comments to this blog about how I manage the flow and storage of the rolling stock on my layout (you can read it at this link: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2011/12/operations-car-flow-and-car-storage.html ). I have a fair number of freight cars beyond what is needed to operate the layout, partly to create variety in operations, but certainly not least because I am a freight car enthusiast. I have always enjoyed researching and building new freight cars, and the result is a car fleet rather distinctly too large for the layout, even with extensive staging capacity.\nOne change I have made is to add some of the A-Line storage boxes. (These products are shown on their website, at: http://www.ppw-aline.com/hobbytote.htm ), though I have never bought the sleeve which makes them into a \u201ctote;\u201d I just buy the boxes.) These do a good job of holding about 16 cars each (for 40-foot cars), and they are well protected. Here is one such box, with the lid set aside.\nI continue to use my paper-carton boxes with trays (as described in the post linked at the top of this post), though because these are less quickly accessible than the A-Line boxes, they have become a kind of \u201cdeep storage\u201d option. Gradually the cars which are less frequently used are migrating into the paper-carton trays. Those cartons and trays were shown in the previous post, a link to which is at the top of this post.\nThe most active \u201cpool\u201d of cars is on the staging table, either made up into mainline trains, or simply in place on the storage tracks. This pool varies over time, with cars migrating off and onto the staging tracks as layout operations continue. Here is a shot of the table as it is at the moment.\nThe table is not quite fully extended, as the furthest track visible is the 11th (there are 12 in all).\nThe other part of the active \u201cpool\u201d storage is the shelving in my adjoining room (the kitchen, when this space was a sub-size apartment). These cars supplement the cars on the staging table. The top and bottom shelves are not really curved, the lens focal length just makes them look that way.\nHow is this managed? I have a chart laying out the sequence(s) of car movements at each industry or other car spot (this procedure, a version of what can be called \u201cdemand-based car flow,\u201d was described previously: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2011/11/operations-demand-based-car-flow-2.html ). From that chart, I make up a list of the movements which are the next sequence of operation, and go to my \u201cpairs list,\u201d described in an earlier post ( at: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2012/02/waybills-17-pairs-list.html ), and thereby find the cars with waybills for each of those car spots, along with the overlay bills for each spot. The waybills are filed by industry, so are readily retrieved. Then the car itself is located in storage by a (searchable) roster of all cars in active service. One of the entries for each car is its location, in a paper carton, in an A-Line box, or in the pool. I summarized an earlier version of this process in a blog post a few months ago (see it at: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2015/07/waybills-part-42-flexibility.html ).\nObviously the car roster is a critical part of this process, and I have learned that the roster has to be kept up to date as cars move around between various storage locations. I usually indicate such movements with pencil corrections on the most recent print-out. When a page gets too heavily marked up, I just update the electronic file and reprint the page.\nAll in all, the process described above does work, and seems to provide good operational movement of cars, while permitting some selection of cars for each movement (because there are multiple waybills for every industry and car spot). I am always experimenting with ways to make the process more efficient, but for now, what I\u2019m describing works well.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T01:04:49Z", "url": "http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2015/", "byte_size": 30313, "char_size": 30129}

I'm tired of apologizing for \"being too busy.\" And I don't want to have to explain why I want something different than than what's considered \"normal.\"\nThat may not make sense to everyone, that may not seem practical to everyone...but why does my life have to pass some unspoken check list?

Infineon will provide a removable solid-state memory unit product, a single-chip application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) wireless game-pad controller that makes cables unnecessary for game play, and an advanced security chip.\nXbox 360 consoles with Infineon-produced chips and components are expected to be on the shelves in the fourth quarter of this year. Financial details of the design collaboration and supply agreement were not disclosed.\n\"Collaboration with leading suppliers of semiconductors and electronic components is essential to the realization of Microsoft's vision to deliver entirely new capabilities in consumer entertainment,\" said Marc Whitten, Director, Xbox Peripherals at Microsoft. \"Infineon's broad and complementary IP portfolio, system integration skill, manufacturing expertise and proven track record were crucial factors in our decision to work with the company on these components.\"\nInfineon is leveraging its IP in areas such as security, memory control and embedded firmware into ASIC-based system solutions for the Xbox 360. For the memory unit, the company designed an ASIC memory controller, created the embedded software that runs on the chip and designed the system printed circuit board. And the security chip is a custom implementation of Infineon's proven authentication technology.\nThe chips were developed in Germany, Israel and Italy and will be manufactured in France. Using the flexibility of Infineon fab clusters, Infineon's ASIC components can be manufactured worldwide in multiple locations, allowing customers additional supply-chain flexibility and opportunity to expand. This is a very important value proposition in the consumer electronics industry where security of supply and reliable high-volume manufacturing are paramount.\n\"Today, customers require a system view to technology development in order to achieve increased performance, lower cost and a higher level of integration.

{"text": "I grew up with stove top mac and cheese. Luckily my mother often made her own from scratch, but I also had the commercial boxed mac and cheese as well. Personally I\u2019ve always prefered stove top to baked. I know, it is controversial. There is something to that velvety sauce and soft texture. It is simple and concise.\nHowever, as I grew up, the idea of making it from scratch seemed more and more improbable. So I leaned toward the box. Now I am not saying that something is bad if it is in a box but powdered things often don\u2019t feel super healthy in the food realm. Especially if all you are adding to them is butter and hot sauce and maybe tuna from a can. Wait. What?\nYes. I would like to take a moment to address something that we call \u201cShame Food.\u201d What is Shame Food? Shame Food is food that you only feel comfortable eating in private. Far from any witnesses. My big Shame Food experience was when I was doing social work. I would work all day in a pretty intense environment and then commute home and my wife worked another 5-6 hours. So I would get home, eat something, and then take a nap. That thing became my Shame Food. It was inspired by a natural food company\u2019s spicy mac and cheese. (It has since been discontinued.) I would make mac and cheese and add a lot of cheap hot sauce (this was before we had a sauce business) and a can of tuna. I would not even plate it. I would eat the whole thing out of the pot and then take a nap. I mean the nap wasn\u2019t a choice. That box of noodles is meant to feed a family of four. Plus the amount of hot sauce I added meant I wasn\u2019t really enjoying the meal as much as surviving it. I had to recoup.\nThis recipe isn\u2019t that dish. It is tied to that spicy boxed macaroni and cheese, that my wife introduced me to, and we would eat it together at a time that we didn\u2019t eat much. Also the roots are a stove top mac and cheese. The kind where the only powder involved it mustard powder and the spice comes from a complex sauce with a bright balsamic flavor and a nutty essence that pairs well with the gruyere and trust me if you finish it with toasted sesame, you will not regret it. Please enjoy and feel free to share with us your Shame Food.\nPour the pasta into a strainer and place the empty pot back on the stove.\nTurn heat to medium and add the butter.\nOnce the butter has melted, stir in the flour and use a whisk continue for a minute.\nSlowly add the milk and cream while whisking to combine.\nAdd the mustard powder and stir.\nReduce heat to medium-low and add the mascarpone. Continue to whisk.\nBegin adding the cheese a handful at a time while whisking to combine.\nAdd the Hatch Sesame Balsamic Sauce.\nReturn the pasta to the sauce pan and stir to coat.\nIf the sauce seems a little loose then continue to stir the pasta occasionally on low heat.\nServe in bowls topped with toasted sesame seeds and Mexican oregano.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T11:53:51Z", "url": "https://marshallshautesauce.com/blogs/recipes/hatch-sesame-balsamic-macaroni-and-cheese", "byte_size": 2889, "char_size": 2871}

{"text": "The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) has today published a new recommendation on US dollar-denominated funding of banks addressed to the national supervisory authorities of the EU Member States (Document reference: ESRB/2011/2).\nThe US dollar funding markets are of significant importance to EU banks. In the periods 2007-08 and 2010-11, EU banks funding themselves in US dollars were exposed to vulnerabilities, owing, on the one hand, to maturity mismatches between long-term assets and short-term liabilities in US dollars and, on the other, to the risk aversion of US money market funds at times of enhanced market tensions.\nThe ESRB considers that action should be taken to avoid a recurrence of these strains in US dollar-denominated funding of EU banks in the medium term. Even if the recommendations \u2013 by their nature \u2013 are not necessarily aimed at addressing recent market developments, national authorities are called on to report to the ESRB on their implementation by June 2012. To achieve this goal within a relatively short deadline, the recommendation predominantly involves measures to strengthen the use of already existing supervisory tools; but this is also partly because banks have already taken action in order to reduce the risk.\nThe ESRB recommends that the competent authorities intensify their monitoring action to prevent EU credit institutions from accumulating future excessive funding risks in US dollars. In particular, national supervisory authorities are requested to closely monitor maturity mismatches, funding concentration, the use of US dollar currency swaps and intra-group exposures. Moreover, the supervisory authorities should encourage credit institutions to take action before these risks reach an excessive level. At the same time, any measure to limit exposures should avoid having an adverse effect on existing financing in US dollars.\nMoreover, authorities should make sure that EU credit institutions enhance their resilience to strains in the US dollar funding markets. To achieve this, the ESRB recommends that national supervisory authorities ensure that EU banks include management actions in their contingency funding plans for handling a shock in US dollar funding. In addition, the national supervisory authorities should assess the feasibility of these plans at the level of the banking sector. Based on this assessment, if there were to be a risk of simultaneous and similar responses by several banks in the face of a crisis, the supervisory authorities should consider action to diminish a potential systemic impact.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T16:39:57Z", "url": "https://www.esrb.europa.eu/news/pr/date/2012/html/pr120116_1.en.html", "byte_size": 2583, "char_size": 2579}

{"text": "Attendify is an event management software that enables users to create event mobile apps and websites. Its features include event registration, lead retrieval, real-time analytics, data management, and more. In this article, we cover Attendify reviews and pricing. Ready to get started? Request a demo.\nUsers who gave Attendify a positive review said that the software efficiently communicates event agenda and schedule to their target attendees. Some of them mentioned that setting up events is very intuitive and the program provides a social interface for identifying potential event attendees.\nUsers who gave Attendify a negative review said that their target event attendees were initially hesitant to download the event app. Some of them reported issues with downloading graphics that do not display correctly on mobile devices. A few of them also wished for options to create an attendee database and a full document library that can hold various file types (.pdf, .doc, .ppt, and .xcl).\nAttendify pricing has four subscription plans: Starter ($200/month), Basic ($900/month), Pro ($1,600/month), and Premier ($2,900/month). The main differences between the plans are the number of registrations, event app credits, audience contracts, and lead retrieval discounts.\nAttendify offers pay-as-you-go options: Registration (2.5% plus $1 per ticket sold) and Event App ($999 per event). There are discounts available to the following: charitable organizations (20%), educational institutions (10%), and religious organizations (10%).\nReady to get started with Attendify? Request a demo.\nHow long does it take for Attendify users to build their event app?\nMany of Attendify users are up and running with their own custom apps within 30 to 90 minutes.\nUsers just need to enter some basic information about their event, follow the prompts to build and preview their app, submit it, and they are done.\nCan Attendify users update the event website and event app at the same time?\nYes. Attendify users can convert their event app into an event website or simply push the content from their event app into an existing website.\nHave you read these Attendify reviews and are still not sure if it\u2019s the right fit for you? Read our reviews of all top event management software or check out one of these three Attendify competitors.\nAttendify is super-easy to use. It\u2019s intuitive, so training someone new to it is a cinch. Within five minutes you can train a colleague on how to enter content into your event app and viola! They are off and running. Also, their staff are great at getting back to you. If you have a question, you will usually get an answer the same day, often times within an hour.\nI just wish we knew about Attendify sooner.\nAttendify takes an apparently overwhelming task, such as building a conference application, and makes it simple! The interface is simple and simple, without the need for coding. In the time it takes to publish a blog in WordPress, you can create an application with Attendify.\nI have very few cons on Attendify, but some of our assistants came to ask me about the possibility of adding their own events along with the events in the application.\nWe are a non-profit association. Many of our assistants are also speakers. It would be nice if your personal profile and speaker profile could be connected.\nThis software has seemed to us to be one of the most reliable, as well as easy and has a well-designed design, it does not strain your eyes nor is it a headache to experiment with it.\nWe like the product as it is, it has no defects, in fact it is very complete and although at first we complained about the technical support that we did not like from the beginning, we have already been able to leave this thinking aside.\nFrom the beginning we did not like technical support, which was the only thing we would have liked to know before we started using the application but now they have improved their customer service.\nWe love how good our event apps are at Attendify! We have used the product for three years and every year we received such great comments about our application. We also love how simple it is to configure and use.\nIt has been difficult to explain the registration process to new users. Some attendees are still skeptical about the use of an application during the conference. Some do not want to install software on their phones and have opted to use the version of the website, which could use a little more functionality.\nIt has all the features we need and it is extremely easy to configure and maintain.

In flowering plants the cycle goes like this: seeds in the soil germinate. They then grow roots and shoots. The next stage is a seedling which matures into an adult plant and makes flowers. Then the plant makes fruit which itself contains seeds. These are spread through dispersal and the cycle starts again.

{"text": "As a qualified psychotherapist, I work with the client to gently explore what it is that they wish to change, whether it be something within themselves, or old patterns of behaviour that no longer serve them well in life, so that they can lead more fulfilling and productive lives. I provide a caring, non-judgemental space where the therapeutic relationship can grow and the client feels nurtured, supported and understood.\nHaving trained as a somatic psychotherapist, I believe that the body is an integral part of our being, and cannot be separated from the mind. From my training, I also incorporate the latest developments in neurobiology, human developmental theory, attachment theory, trauma theory, selfpsychology and intersubjectivity. I also use mindfulness-based practices.\nAs a member of the Australian Somatic Psychotherapy Association, I am committed to undertaking ongoing personal and professional development, including regular clinical supervision of my work. I practice in accordance with the stringent ethical guidelines of this association.\nI have been assisting people on their personal journeys of self-tranformation, with a variety of issues for the past 8 years, with wonderful results. I have also been a high school teacher for over 30 years and with empathy and compassion, have enabled many students to be the best that they can be and to transform the quality of their lives.\nFor many years as a high school teacher, I worked with students who did the best that they could with what their life experiences had dealt them, with students who struggled to achieve their full potential. Many of these students had been labelled as troublemakers who impeded the progress of others in the classroom and therefore needed to be (and were) punished for not conforming or behaving. I felt some frustration that in schools, because time and resources are limited, I was not able to help such students as much as I would have liked.\nI noticed a huge difference in one particular student who had been labelled as \u2018a troublemaker\u2019, after I spent some time really listening to him, rather than reacting to his behaviour. He opened up and eventually became a \u2018model student\u2019 who went on, not only to achieve excellent academic results, but also, after seeing a therapist, dealt with his issues and went on to become a wonderful husband and father.\nI felt motivated to spend time working as a volunteer, supporting people work through their issues on personal development courses, and during this time, felt a driving passion to retire from full-time teaching so that I could become a therapist.\nMy training as a Somatic Psychotherapist involved a thorough grounding in a mixture of the best established psychotherapeutic theories, from roots in Freudian psychology, through the many different movements that evolved over the years, as well as the fruits of cutting-edge research into psychotherapy and human development, and neurobiology.\nI have been influenced by a number of approaches, beginning with Kohut\u2019s concept of empathic attunement (Selfpsychology ), including infant and child development theory, the enormous contribution of John Bowlby and others in Attachment Theory and Intersubjectivity Theory. I am particularly excited by the new developments in neurobiology, particularly as it relates to trauma and neglect and evidence that people\u2019s brains can be rewired within the therapist-client relationship.\nAs a Contemporary Somatic Psychotherapist, I embrace a comprehensive approach to personal growth and development which acknowledges that all facets of human experience are interrelated i.e. that the processes of the body/mind not only affect and reflect each other, but are actually inter-functioning aspects of a person's whole being. Each person's individual history, their cultural/biological context and bodily-based subjective reality are all inextricably intertwined.\nI also integrate mindfulness practices in to my daily life and in my work as a therapist.\nI am particularly interested in the neurobiology of trauma and development and how they impact on the organisation of the brain and subsequently on the organisation of an individual\u2019s experience. I feel that it is immensely important to have an understanding of trauma and its impact, in order to work with traumatised individuals. Longer term and more lasting healing of traumatised individuals have been recently seen as resulting from the laying down of new neural pathways, achieved from repeated new experiences in therapy, in contrast to treatment in the medical model which pathologises and medicates.\nThe work on infant and child development, including Attachment Theory, and how the brain is affected by neglect, continues to fascinate me, particularly in the context of neurobiology, and how through therapy, healing can be achieved when stages of development which were interrupted in the life-cycle can be reinstated.\nAs a Somatic Psychotherapist, I believe in a holistic approach, that the mind and body are integrated. I work within a broadly humanistic and psychodynamic framework that is inclusive of the body, where the relationship between the client and myself is developed and valued, taking in to account each of our experiences and with a particular focus on what is happening in the present moment. Because we embody our experience, somatic cues as well as verbal information provided by the client are observed and when necessary, used to give feedback to the client, so that together, we can gently explore what is happening for the client, while the client experiences being supported in this process.\nFor many people, anxiety and depression are the result of the stresses of a busy lifestyle, where too much is expected of them (by themselves and/or others) and they have lost the ability to self-regulate. Medication is not always the answer, sometimes all that is needed is empathic listening and empathic attunement, so that the client feels safe and can just be, without having to do anything, where they can be listened to, without judgement, and feel understood. This in turn can lead to better self-regulation and the implementation of more successful coping mechanisms. The client then can then, armed with an awareness of what they need to change as well as support, face difficulties and overcome obstacles, so that they can make different choices and thereby have the life that they desire and deserve.\nSome clients choose to have Bio-dynamic massage, which is a deeply nurturing experience in its own right, where the emphasis is on soothing the nervous system. This is entirely the client\u2019s choice to work in this way.\nProgress will of course vary from client to client, depending on the client\u2019s experience, history, their level of awareness and current circumstance. It can be very slow and extremely subtle, often out of awareness. For some, huge progress may consist of picking up the phone and making that first appointment, then in turning up, then in coming back and continuing in spite of the temptations not to do so. Facing one\u2019s fears and expressing them (either verbally or somatically), then facing them and attempting different coping strategies for difficulties/issues are all examples of significant progress which may be dismissed or minimalised or even overlooked.\nI personally feel that the client starts to feel that progress is being made when they truly feel (even out of awareness) that they are heard, understood and accepted, unconditionally and without judgement. This may be a feeling (such as relief, or a sense of trust or of being held or supported), rather than something that can be verbalised, or it can be a bodily experience, such as a deep sigh, or tears. Understanding may come later as to why, but this is something for the client and therapist to gently explore together.\nTherapy has made me a better person because it has allowed me to embrace all parts of my self, including the parts that I learnt at an early age to suppress or disavow. It provided a safe place where I felt understood and supported, which in turn led me to want to explore the rationale behind the behaviours and relationships that I was choosing in my life, which invariably were not helpful in attaining the joy that was my birthright. Through a development of my understanding, I was able to further develop my self-reflective and relational capacities.\nIn becoming more accepting of myself, I am able to empathise with others and to practice non-judgement, be a better listener, as well as provide support for others without losing myself in the process. I am able to ask for and accept support, and see self-care as being a necessity rather than an indulgence.\nAs a young child, I learnt at an early age that approval from my parents through being a high achiever was paramount to my sense of well-being. Like many, I became a driven by perfectionism, which later in life, invariably led to frustration, because that perfection could not be achieved. Through therapy, I have come to accept and like who I am, warts and all, and no longer needing to seek validation of my self-worth from external sources, but from within. I am able to have more choice in my life. I am grateful for so much more, and as a result, can allow myself to experience a fuller range of emotions and feelings, and to see that as healthy.\nI am able to experience each day with whatever it brings, acknowledging the past without regrets, and looking forward to whatever may arise in the future, learning from each experience, whilst remaining true to myself and to my values and beliefs.\nWhat I love most is that a client trusts me enough to take that courageous leap of faith to change something in their life that is not working for them, and allow me to support them on their journey to enhance the quality of their life. I feel very humbled and privileged to be able to do the work that I do and to see clients gradually become empowered to lead more satisfying lives.\nIt is extremely rewarding to be able to work together to change patterns of behaviour that are not helpful, to have the client experience an increase in their self-esteem, to provide tools and the practice of using those tools so that they can have a different experience, which will lead to the realisation that they have the potential to achieve so much more from their lives.\nIt is truly heart-warming to see a client feeling safe enough to allow themselves to be vulnerable, to work through difficulties and fears together, to make the brave decision to work more deeply and then to see them come through the other side, having more choice in their lives. In addition, I learn so much more about myself and grow from time spent with each client.\nYes, of course I do. I am, after all, a human being, with all of the fallibilities, vulnerabilities and weaknesses (and strengths) that are part of the human condition. I am also a product of my past experiences and the relationships that have shaped me, and can be, and am, triggered by events that occur, often outside of my awareness. I am fortunate in that I have had training, have done lots of self-development work, engage in mindfulness practices such as meditation, and have ongoing therapy, so that I can deal with my bad hair days in ways that serve me better.\nPart of my success in dealing with bad hair days is acceptance that they do (and will) happen, rather than trying to disavow them, or wish that they didn\u2019t happen, or worse still, blaming myself. Awareness of why they happen can be helpful (although not always necessary), although I personally find that awareness of how I react is more useful to me in order to change how I handle similar situations should they arise again (and not surprising, they do!). Asking for and accepting help, something that I used to struggle with, help tremendously too. Spending time in the company of like-minded people also provides ongoing support.\nThe other key factor for me in handling bad hair days is to connect with nature, such as taking a walk along the beach, spending time playing with my cat, or spending time in my vegie patch with my chooks, for engaging with my environment gives me \u2018the bigger picture\u2019 perspective. Having gratitude for my life, my health and the people in it helps me cope with those \u2018bad hair\u2019 days.\nI think that the most significant problem that we face stems from a lack of harmony, imbalance with our planet, imbalance with each other, and imbalance within ourselves. Many people on this planet are struggling with obesity, whilst many others are dying from starvation. People are killing each other and destroying the planet. There is an inequitable distribution of wealth, success in many places is measured by how much wealth one can acquire in a lifetime, rather than on how humanely or compassionately one lives.\nThis causes a lot of stress in people\u2019s lives as they feel that they cannot live up to the expectations that they, and others, place on themselves, and this leads in turn, to imbalance. From this stance, for many, it is difficult to feel gratitude or compassion, to extend kindness or to be non-judgemental with others, let alone with oneself.\nMany people are more reactive than proactive and change is difficult. It is often difficult for people to communicate honestly and openly about what is going on for them, when it is not safe to do so or when unaware of what is going on internally. When one does not feel good about oneself, it is often difficult to really feel good about anything else, let alone have compassion for others, and so on the cycle continues.\nIt is important to break the cycle, by providing a safe, non-judgemental space, where a person can feel supported and begin to restore their self-esteem, so that they can begin to restore balance within themselves, then in turn in their lives and within their environment. Sadly, for many people on this planet, their world IS a dangerous place where their very existence is indeed under threat.\nThere are many books, films, songs, events and works of art that have inspired me and on a daily basis, new ones that inspire me. I am also constantly inspired by people, many of whom would not consider themselves to be inspirational, who are struggling to eke out an existence, overcoming adversity and who exhibit incredible courage battling illness and difficult challenges that life throws them.\nPerhaps the most significant piece of writing that inspired me, was one of my textbooks from my training, Robert Karen\u2019s \u201cBecoming Attached - First Relationships and How They Shape the Capacity to Love\u201d (1988).\nThe title of this book unseated a deep inexplicable fear in me, which manifested itself in a reluctance to even open the cover of the book, followed by procrastination over reading it. Once I forced myself to read it (I had to, as it was compulsory reading as part of my training), I began to gain an understanding of what my fear was about and to work through it. The book provides an excellent summary of the history of Attachment Theory and the significant impact of early attachment history on a person\u2019s ability throughout life, not only to love, but to handle difficulties or even crises in their lives.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T14:45:40Z", "url": "https://www.goodtherapy.com.au/april_lewis", "byte_size": 15284, "char_size": 15244}

{"text": "As we're late to the game for Breaking Bad, we're enjoying exploring this story via Netflix and it's quite the ride. While we're not exactly new to such serialized storytelling, the fact that it was still pretty much created during the more episodic broadcast era makes it clear why it stood out so much when it came out. This doesn't even touch on how great the story is.\nI didn't expect to get into a series focused on a high school chemistry dealer who becomes a drug \"cook\" but here we are. And the way they've crafted the series with all of its nuances and complexities does make for pretty powerful storytelling indeed.\nThe serialized story is not a new concept and we've seen it come and go over the years. But I guess the binge-watching behavior supported by services like Netflix have helped make shows like this even more powerful since it's pretty intense to watch the show in quicker succession instead of a weekly basis.\nSynopsis: Breaking Bad is a drama TV series created and produced by Vince Gilligan for AMC. The show has won many awards over the years and is known as one of the greatest television shows of all time.\nThis second season begins with the tense stand-off with Tuco (Raymond Cruz) and Walt / Heisenberg (Bryan Cranston) together with Jessie (Aaron Paul). In the end Tuco kidnaps them and stows them away in a shack in the desert together with his aging uncle (Mark Margolis), who is a former drug lord in his own right. At the same time, Walt's brother-in-law Hank (Dean Norries) has the DEA all over Tuco's organization as they try to crack down on their operation.\nMeanwhile Walt's wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) is pregnant and wondering where Walt has disappeared to. She remains in the dark about Walt's drug operation and how he's paying for his cancer treatments. And all that is hardly a priority with Walt missing. And while he eventually escapes his captors to make his way back, there's still the other challenge of figuring out how to explain his disappearance.\nWhat I Liked: I think I mentioned before how much I've come to enjoy how the story seems to play out like a game of Fiasco with twist after disastrous twist. You're already stuck in a weird place with being undecided about whether or not you really want to root for these two as they are in fact involved in illegal drugs. But the whole story remains so compelling that you end up cheering at both their successes and their failures.\nThis season also had Jesse trying to learn to step up and be more than Walt's flunkie and Walt in turn tapping into his slow burning rage deep inside to come to some pretty cold decisions. At first he was just a desperate man trying to do right by his family. But as we see in this season, hes also descending into a dark place that he feels he needs to be in order to be the meth cook Heisenberg.\nWhat Could Have Been Better: There are some asides and parallel story tracks that don't resonate quite as well for me. Skyler isn't the best of characters in this season although Anna Gunn does her best with what she has to work with. The same goes for Walt Jr., his son, who is a bit of a non-etity in most of the show.\nAnd so there are a lot of uncomfortable situations where the show painfully becomes about Sykle or her DEA brother Hank in sub-plots that can get a little long-winded or rather boring at times. You end up wanting to go back to the action with Walt and such, but I understand the direction of things.\nTL;DR: Breaking Bad is quite the phenomenal story and this second season continues to take things forward as Walt explores this darker path for himself. It's a story with inherent tragedy and yet it all works out still, and that's the magic of it. So this second season gets 5 moments when Saul comes to save the day out of possible 5.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T16:05:16Z", "url": "https://www.geeky-guide.com/2017/11/tv-breaking-bad-season-2-review.html", "byte_size": 3786, "char_size": 3786}

The new technology has been announced by Sygic Smart City Solution Architect Radim Cmar at Vienna, Austria-based Transport Research Arena running from today through Thursday, with the Slovakian company describing it as its answer to the issue of urban traffic congestion that's still worsening on a global level every year, according to a number of recent surveys, including TomTom's 2017 Traffic Index published in late February.\nSygic claims that its Smart Mobility Platform allows city administrations to monitor commuting patterns in their jurisdictions and optimize their operations in a more effective manner with such data in mind, in addition to delivering a solution that enables more streamlined traffic management app development across the board. The framework can be leveraged for creating all kinds of mobility apps catering to commuters with the goal of directing users to the least populated routes to their destinations, consequently combating urban traffic congestion. The newly announced technology allows for real-time traffic level predictions and is also able to utilize them in the context of more complex applications such as city-wide mobility forecasts meant to help authorities make the best of their infrastructure so as to avoid congestion whenever possible.\nThe scope of commuter data collected by the platform can hence benefit a wide variety of urban planning encompassing transit routers, infrastructure buildouts, traffic signaling, and general traffic improvements, according to the company. The newly launched solution is powered by Microsoft's Azure platform and will be made available to city administrations in the coming weeks.

If you do not find the exact resolution you are looking for, then go for a native or higher resolution.\nAmong probably the most popular electrical wiring issues is on how to wire a swap. When working with switches at home is fairly quick, wiring one may well not be that quick for everyone. An ON-OFF switch is actually quite simple to wire. There are actually different types of switches, but for this example, let us say you will be setting up a single-pole toggle switch, an incredibly common change (plus the most straightforward).\nThere are a few colours of wires in a usual single-pole toggle switch: black, white, and green. Splice the black wire in two and connect them over the terminal screws - one particular on leading as well as the other about the base screw in the change. The white wire serves for a source of uninterrupted ability and is ordinarily linked to the light coloured terminal screw (e.g., silver). Connect the inexperienced wire into the ground screw within your switch.\nThese measures would generally be adequate to generate a normal change do the job and not using a issue. Nevertheless, when you are certainly not self-assured that you simply can execute the undertaking properly and securely you much better let the professionals do it as an alternative. Soon after all, you can find a cause why this endeavor is one of the most frequent electrical wiring concerns asked by most people.\nFor some motive, the way to wire a ceiling fan is usually certainly one of by far the most widespread electrical wiring queries. To simplify this undertaking, you should use just one swap for any single ceiling fan. To wire the lover, it truly is simply a matter of connecting the black wire on the ceiling fan into the black wire in the switch. When there is a light, the blue wire ought to be related on the black wire of the switch too.\nThere are explanations why they are probably the most typically asked electrical wiring inquiries. Just one, lots of imagine it is really very simple to do, and two, these are generally the widespread electrical responsibilities at your house.

{"text": "Phew! Do you feel like an emotional husk after yesterday's big wave carnage and confounded trying to keep up with a blast of events happening at the same time? Spike summarises for us.\nWhat a crazy day of surfing, and its been and will be happening today, again, at the business end of the surfing and SUP season. Stephanie Gilmore just won the women's WSL Championship Tour after surfing in one heat but the clincher for her was when main challenger Lakey Peterson was eliminated from the Beachwaver Maui Pro in cranking 8 foot surf.\nThen, Keana Kennelly won the women's BWT last night by trying to commit hara kiri on waves already bordering on tow only. The same went for the men afterwards. Even they were in way over their heads, so to speak. Did you know they called off the men's event not because they thought it too dangerous (at first) but because they literally 'lost' Russel Bierke at Jaws last night? For me, the red light was already flashing like a strobe light watching the women's suicidal commitment.\nGut wrenching stuff! Then we had to watch the same trait to end life as we know it by the men. Was that barrel that Twiggy planed into - a hair's breath away from another flotation vest-ripping, bone-snapping over the falls death dance - the biggest barrel paddled into in the history of .... like everything?\nIt was insane. Well, we have more of the same tonight. Tighten your britches bru, stomach in, chest out! Try stock up on adrenaline after it was sucked dry last night.\nToday is a busy day in the water world of waves and SUP. The Vans World Cup is on at Sunset beach and Jordy Smith joins six other Saffas in the lineup (and seven if you count Benji Brand), with Jordy winning his Round 1 heat and leapfrogging Round 2 direct to Round 3. Dylan Lightfoot, Mikey February, Adin Masencamp, Matthew McGillivray, Beyrick De Vries, and David van Zyl are all through to four-man Round 2 heats with the top two joining the top two who went direct to Round 3. Oh, and Sunset is fire ing.\nThe ISA World SUP and Paddleboard Champs just wound down the day in China, with the SUP Surfing done after Riyue Bay was fed by waves from a typhoon. Sadly, despite a good show, Thomas King dropped out in Repecharge Heat 7, two heats from the final. But he's into the Men's technical race repercharge, as is Kimon dos Santos, which is one heat from the final. Tarryn King has made the women's final main event of Technical Racing, with Tamsyn Foster into the repecharge.\nThen there's the Taiwan Open World Longboarding Champs running in a parallel time zone in Taiwan. Four Saffas are there. Steezy Sawyer (24) of Jeffreys Bay, Sam Christianson (20) Alfonzo Pieters (29) and Chrystal Hulett (22). Matthew Moir had a wildcard entry, but apparently has too much work going on, and couldn't attend.\nEven without Mouse, this is the most experienced group to attend a WSL Longboard Championships. Steezy Sawyer, despite breaking his board and taking a sip of piss in a bizarre bit of miscommunication, is through to Round 3 and is a big favourite. Muizenberg local Pieters was knocked out in Round 2, but Christianson prevailed in the last heat of the day a short while ago (11am SA time). Hulett is up early tomorrow.\nJinsun Harbour has had lank swell, and the longboarders are ripping. In a first for the WSL, world champions from two separate disciplines will be crowned at the same venue when the WSL Junior Surfing Championships follow the longboarding from 1-9 December.\n\"Round 2\" of the big wave surfing at Jaws (and conditions look just as hairy, though hopefully a little more benign) will be called at around 7pm this evening SA time.\nYou'll be spoiled for choice, with the Vans Triple Crown event at Sunset also set to kickstart this evening around the same time, or a bit later. PLUS we have the women's Beachwaver Maui Pro continuing too, and the surf as you know is GOING OFF in Hawaii.\nBy the way, amidst the women's CT world title excitement, spare a thought for Ventura native Sage Erickson, who was on the opposite end of the spectrum shored up by Gilmore's elation. Like Lakey, she was eliminated in Round 2 by Nikki Van Dijk, which means she fails to requalify for 2019. She also narrowly misses requalifying via the QS by one heat at the Port Stephens Toyota Pro earlier this month.\nAnyway, get the AV going, and get ready to bounce around to different events like a crazy person.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T22:34:21Z", "url": "https://www.wavescape.co.za/surf-news/breaking-news/surfing-world-explodes.html", "byte_size": 4403, "char_size": 4403}

{"text": "The courts don\u2019t expect your company\u2019s OHS program to be perfect. To make out a due diligence defence, your company must prove only that it made reasonable efforts to comply with the law and protect workers\u2019 health and safety. But the courts do expect you to take all reasonable steps toward compliance\u2014not just some steps.\n> Institute a formal hazard assessment for any work or activity in the areas where asbestos was present [R. v. Della Valle]. .\nThe OHS laws only require companies to protect workers from reasonably foreseeable hazards. The standard for determining whether a hazard was foreseeable is not what risks the company actually did foresee but what a reasonably prudent person in the same situation would have foreseen. If a safety incident or violation was foreseeable, the company will be held liable if it didn\u2019t take all reasonable steps to prevent the incident or violation.\nExample: A backhoe operator snagged a natural gas riser, causing gas to seep into a nearby butcher shop. The shop exploded, killing two people, seriously injuring five others and causing extensive property damage. The operator was convicted of two OHS violations. The court pointed out that the operator knew the risk of working around live gas lines and the potentially serious consequences of hitting a gas line with his backhoe. So doing so was clearly a foreseeable hazard. But the operator, who had plenty of time, didn\u2019t take reasonable steps to avoid snagging a gas line, such as carefully digging with a shovel to expose the riser. In short, the court called the operator\u2019s actions incredibly risky and the incident \u201centirely foreseeable\u201d [R. v. Riemer]. .\nIf a hazard was not only foreseeable but actually known to the company, failing to address it is fatal to successfully arguing that you exercised due diligence.\nExample #1: During blasting for a roadway construction project, flyrock showered a nearby trailer court, destroying a shed, crashing through a trailer\u2019s roof and forcing a tenant to run for safety. The contractor and a supervisor were convicted of OHS violations and appealed. In upholding their convictions, the court noted that they knew damage from blasting was foreseeable because a prior blast during this project had caused flyrock to reach the same trailer court, thus demonstrating what could happen if proper safety precautions weren\u2019t followed. The practical wisdom from that prior incident should\u2019ve \u201cinformed reasonableness and safe practice,\u201d said the court. It added, \u201cPast experience can be a reliable predictor of future incidents or damage\u201d [R. v. Government of Yukon].\nExample #2: A technology company held a customer appreciation event that featured a mechanical calf roping machine operated by the company\u2019s employees. The machine had a faulty spring. So the operator had to reach into it to manually release a hook. While a worker was doing so, he was hit in the back of the head by a steel lever and died. The appeals court pointed out that before the fatality, another worker operating the machine had been hit on the shoulder by the lever. So although the specific type of injury the worker who died suffered may not have been foreseen, the potential danger of being struck by this lever while reaching into the machine was a \u201creasonable prospect,\u201d explained the court. Once this hazard was detected, a reasonable employer would have discontinued use of the machine and not permitted untrained workers to operate it. But despite being aware of the potential dangers associated with the machine, the company allowed the continued use of this equipment [R. v. XI Technologies Inc.]. .\nYour company\u2019s safety rules and procedures must be in writing. Verbal safety procedures are too easily misunderstood, which can have serious\u2014and often fatal\u2014consequences. Written safety procedures that spell out exactly what\u2019s required and when are less likely to be misunderstood. As a result, courts will typically rule that due diligence requires written safety procedures.\nYes, your OHS program must include thorough, written safety rules and procedures. But that\u2019s not enough to prove due diligence. You must also properly train workers on those rules and procedures. And that training must be adequate.\nExample #1: In the Linamar case discussed above, the court ruled that the employer needed to develop not only a written policy on troubleshooting but also a related program for training workers on that policy.\nExample #2: A flagger working along a highway was run over by an excavator operated by a co-worker and crushed to death. His employer was convicted of, among other things, failing to provide proper training to workers at the site. The court found that although the employer provided some instruction and training to workers, it was minimal and not to the extent required to prove due diligence [R. v. Concord Paving Ltd.].\nProviding adequate training to workers isn\u2019t going to help you prove due diligence if you can\u2019t demonstrate that you provided such training. So you must document the nature and extent of the training the company provides its workers.\nExample #1: In the Concord Paving case discussed above, the court noted that the employer\u2019s OHS program manual contained a form for documenting the safety courses that workers took. But at trial, it didn\u2019t produce any such forms for the workers involved in the incident to prove that they\u2019d taken any safety courses.\nExample #2: A temporary worker for a salvage company fell approximately three metres from an opening in a wall onto a pile of pipe, suffering a broken leg and three broken ribs. The company was convicted of several safety violations. Among other factors that led to a finding of no due diligence, the court said that although the company claimed that it provided workers with a safety orientation, it had no documentation to prove that claim [R. v. Canadian Consolidated Salvage Ltd. (Clearway Recycling)].\nAs important as adequate training is, you must also ensure that workers are appropriately supervised while on the job in order to prove due diligence. That\u2019s because proper supervision is the best way to ensure workers are actually applying their training.\nExample: At a bridge construction project, a safety inspector saw workers working 20 to 50 feet above the ground without adequate fall protection in the form of guardrails or handrails. In addition, the workers were attached to a horizontal lifeline that wasn\u2019t properly engineered. The employer appealed its conviction for violating the fall protection and supervision requirements, pointing to the training it provided to workers on fall protection. But the Tribunal explained, \u201cTraining alone does not meet the requirements of due diligence, if there is not adequate supervision to ensure that the knowledge provided through training is being correctly and consistently applied\u201d [WCAT-2012-00224].\nAnd the need for appropriate supervision applies to all workers\u2014even those who are experienced.\nExample: During an inspection of a residential construction project, a safety officer saw an experienced journeyman carpenter working about 18 feet above the ground without his fall protection harness attached to a lifeline. The construction company was penalized for fall protection violations, which it appealed. The Tribunal acknowledged that the carpenter had more than 20 years\u2019 experience and was familiar with the fall protection requirements. In fact, he admitted that he should\u2019ve attached his harness to a lifeline. But the Tribunal noted that there was no evidence that he was properly supervised to ensure he complied with these requirements. It appears that the company simply opted to rely on his experience, training and knowledge [WCAT-2012-00416].\nCompanies have a duty to ensure that workers follow safety rules and procedures and comply with the OHS laws. To that end, you should take steps to convey to workers the importance of safety compliance\u2014and the ramifications of safety infractions. For example, when workers violate safety rules, you must discipline them.\nExample #1: At a residential construction site, a safety officer saw two workers, who were approximately 18 feet above the ground, not wearing fall protection harnesses. And there was no fall protection equipment on the roof. The construction company was penalized for a fall protection violation and appealed. The employer argued that it provided extensive training on fall protection requirements. But the Tribunal said the company\u2019s training and education efforts weren\u2019t sufficient for workers to understand the importance of complying with those requirements or the consequences of non-compliance. For example, the company didn\u2019t implement a progressive discipline program for safety infractions until after this incident [WCAT-2011-02413].\nExample #2: A safety officer inspecting a roofing project saw a worker and supervisor on a roof about 24 feet above the ground when neither was connected to a lifeline. During an inspection of another company worksite, two workers on a roof weren\u2019t connected to lifelines. The company was penalized for failing to comply with the fall protection requirements and provide adequate training and supervision. It appealed. The Tribunal said that although the company provided fall protection training and had a progressive discipline program for safety infractions, it knew that workers were ignoring the fall protection requirements. So it should\u2019ve realized that its efforts weren\u2019t preventing or deterring fall protection violations and done more, such as providing bonuses for safety compliance [WCAT-2011-02507].\nWhen a company is charged with a safety offence, it may try to point the finger at the workers involved, arguing that it took all reasonable steps and the workers simply disregarded safety protocol. Such an argument is unlikely to convince a court.\nExample #1: In WCAT-2011-02413 discussed above, the company argued that it was the independent actions of the workers that led to the violations, saying they forgot to put their fall protection equipment back on after their lunch break. The Tribunal noted that although the workers themselves could\u2019ve been hit with violations for their actions, their failure doesn\u2019t relieve the company of its duties under the OHS laws.\nExample #2: In Linamar, which was previously discussed, the employer argued that the worker got injured because he didn\u2019t use a spotter as required. But the court noted that the training wasn\u2019t clear as to the proper use of a spotter.\nBecause supervisors are responsible for ensuring that workers follow safety rules and comply with the OHS law, they should be held to a higher standard when it comes to safety infractions. So when a supervisor violates a safety rule, the consequences should be more severe than if a worker had committed the same infraction.\nExample: In WCAT-2011-02507 mentioned above, a worker and supervisor were seen by a safety inspector not wearing fall protection equipment when required. But the Tribunal said it wasn\u2019t apparent that the company held the supervisor more accountable for his actions than the worker, noting \u201cthe supervisor is responsible for setting an example to workers.\u201d In fact, the employer simply gave both a verbal warning.\nYou must ensure that workers are supervised by actual supervisors and not leave that responsibility to their co-workers.\nExample: A 22-year-old sawmill worker got caught in the pinchpoint of a canter machine and died. The sawmill was convicted of violating the supervision requirements. The Tribunal noted that the worker was young and had been on the job for less than a year. A supervisor had warned him before this incident about performing duties that weren\u2019t his own. Under these circumstances, he should\u2019ve been closely supervised but he wasn\u2019t. The fact that there were experienced and knowledgeable co-workers working in the same area as this worker wasn\u2019t a substitute for the presence of an actual supervisor. So the Tribunal concluded that the sawmill failed to satisfy its duty to provide adequate supervision [WCAT-2011-02783].\nIn general, employers can\u2019t avoid fulfilling their OHS duties by delegating them to someone else, such as a contractor or subcontractor.\nExample #1: In Canadian Consolidated Salvage, previously discussed, the company argued that the prime contractor was responsible for supervising all workers\u2014including the company\u2019s\u2014and complying with all safety requirements. So it had no duty to ensure the safety of its workers at that site. But the court said because the company was the injured worker\u2019s employer under the OHS laws, it was responsible for ensuring his safety at the site. And there was no evidence that the company took \u201cany steps whatsoever\u201d to protect its workers.\nExample #2: The contractor and supervisor in the Yukon case argued that hiring an experienced blaster relieved them of their duties under the OHS law. The court explained that the OHS law has \u201coverlapping obligations\u201d that mean everyone had a duty to ensure a safe blast. And there was no evidence that the contractor had a system in place to ensure that all blasting was done safely.\nThe same rule applies to suppliers who provide you with equipment and materials.\nExample: In the XI Technologies case, the company argued that it wasn\u2019t foreseeable that the supplier would provide it with an unsafe machine. In essence, the company assumed that the equipment would be safe to use. But the appeals court explained that the OHS law required the company, as an employer, to take reasonable steps to ensure that such equipment was, in fact, safe to operate as intended. And there were \u201crudimentary steps\u201d the company could\u2019ve taken to do so. For example, the company should\u2019ve asked the supplier for adequate operating instructions or a demonstration of the machine\u2019s proper use, especially considering that it was completely unfamiliar with this equipment. This relatively simple step would\u2019ve alerted operators to the fact that the machine wasn\u2019t working properly. But instead of getting instructions or a demonstration from the supplier, the company chose to rely on its untrained employees to figure out how to safely run the machine.\nCompanies must give workers the information they need to perform their jobs safely, such as MSDSs and safety signage. If that information is inaccurate, it\u2019s almost as bad as\u2014if not worse than\u2014not providing the information at all.\nExample: A safety officer discovered that there were stickers posted in areas on a seagoing vessel that said the areas were \u201casbestos-free\u201d even though materials containing asbestos were present. In ruling that the company didn\u2019t exercise due diligence, the Tribunal pointed out that the company couldn\u2019t explain how inaccurate decals had been put up. And it didn\u2019t have a system in place for double-checking or otherwise ensuring the accuracy of such signage [WCAT-2012-00145].\nCompanies are composed of human beings and humans make mistakes. But courts are unlikely to buy that argument that because a safety violation was simply the product of human error, the company should be excused from liability.\nExample: A safety officer inspecting a construction site found that the company hadn\u2019t gotten an underground locate of all utility services before starting excavation work. The company\u2019s excuse for this oversight was that it was \u201cdue to human error.\u201d But the Tribunal rejected this excuse as non-responsive. It pointed out that \u201caccidents are usually due to human error.\u201d The issue here was whether the company took steps to prevent this particular human error from occurring, which it hadn\u2019t [WCAT-2012-00070].\nMost safety violations are the result of flaws in the OHS program of a company that\u2019s genuinely trying to comply but fell short. But if the violations are particularly egregious, say, because they\u2019re the result of wanton disregard for safety or the failure to take simple and inexpensive steps, the company will not only get convicted but likely face an especially high fine.\nExample: A truck driver was killed when a 15-metre-high wall of dirt and rock fell on him. Two companies were convicted of multiple safety violations. That two experienced construction companies could leave a sheer 50-foot wall without any shoring whatsoever was shocking, said the court. It described their conduct as \u201cegregious and outrageous,\u201d noting that the wall could\u2019ve been properly supported for a relatively small amount of money. As a result, the court imposed record fines totally $2,472,500 on the companies [R. v. Perera Development Corp.].\nAs explained in Part 1, there\u2019s no formula for establishing due diligence, no checklist of steps or actions that, if taken, would guarantee a successful due diligence defence. The best you can do is learn from other companies\u2019 experiences in safety prosecutions. The cases in which the due diligence defence failed illustrate what not to do and which omissions will undercut due diligence. The successful cases can provide a sort of blueprint or guide for the steps and actions your company should be taking.\n3. Anyone charged with a violation of the OHS laws, including companies and individuals, can raise a due diligence defence.\n4. The due diligence defence applies to most violations of so-called \u201cregulatory\u201d laws, such as OHS and environmental laws.\n5. Although due diligence isn\u2019t technically a defence to criminal negligence or \u201cC-45\u201d charges, proving that you exercised due diligence makes it impossible to be convicted of criminal negligence.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T10:24:11Z", "url": "https://ohsinsider.com/topics/due-diligence/the-insiders-8th-annual-due-diligence-scorecard-part-2-what-you-can-learn", "byte_size": 17753, "char_size": 17557}

{"text": "From the birth of Vision to the signing of the Sokovia Accords, the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron continue to send ripples through the Marvel franchise, and yet the film\u2019s titular A.I. seems to have been relegated to the annals of MCU history. According to one fan theory, however, Ultron himself may have actually lasted far beyond his first appearance in the 2015 film.\nIn a new post on Reddit, user EmperorJoker argues \u2013 and probably with good reason \u2013 that the James Spader character had multiple methods of cheating death at the end of his ill-fated battle with Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes. For one thing, Ultron could have saved his consciousness in an unseen drone that stayed away from the film\u2019s climactic battle. But the idea that really sends this post into further speculation is that Ultron may have somehow embedded himself in the mind of Vision.\nWe already know that Paul Bettany\u2019s character is made from parts of Ultron, so it surely isn\u2019t too much of a stretch from here to suggest that there could be traces of the character still living on in the android. What\u2019s more, EmperorJoker argues that Ultron felt little need to continue with his war against humanity because he knew that a certain Mad Titan was on his way to finish the job for him. To theorize further, one way that Ultron may have found out about Thanos\u2019 genocidal plans could have been through the mysterious Mind Stone, which was in the interplanetary conqueror\u2019s possession years before it found its way into the head of Vision.\nWhile it certainly looks like the MCU has long moved on from the main villain of Avengers: Age of Ultron, EmperorJoker\u2019s theory generally comes across as a well-reasoned piece of speculation that could sit well with anyone who wishes there was still some part of this psychotic A.I. that persisted beyond his one-movie run. Of course, if this theory is legit, then you have to wonder if Ultron had a second escape plan for when Vision was brutally slain by Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T11:58:31Z", "url": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/avengers-age-ultron-theory-says-ultron-still-alive/", "byte_size": 2026, "char_size": 2004}

But pieces that are beautifully understated in their elegance can be more of a challenge to come across. Perhaps because it's easy to overdo, but timelessness takes balance and the right materials like those favored by Ellen vanHully-Bronson of Pearl Kissed Jewelry. Most of Ellen's collections are centered around one of Mother Nature's most delicate and classic \"gems\" - the fresh water pearl. Her necklaces, bracelets and earrings are all handmade and one-of-a-kind, much like each naturally derived pearl. Her designs are meant to convey an air of elegance and romance, from her simpler strings of silver and the occasional pearl bead or crystal to the more intricate signature necklace with woven \"branches\" that sit gracefully along your neckline. Ellen's pieces make wonderful gifts for moms, daughters, sisters, wives and more. A Pearl Kissed necklace can enhance any outfit, from the more casual to an evening dress. They are that charming and versatile. While Ellen has a handful of self-designed collections, she is happy to discuss custom requests for a piece that's as special as its future wearer. That makes her work very well suited for bridal parties to match the romance you want on your special day! I love how creativity runs in Ellen's family, with this business originally started as a mother - daughter duo. Her daughter then continued to follow her passions to metalwork, but still offers input on design and marketing to help drive success.

The outdoor shower area has been rebuilt to eliminate a step, and easy-to-turn handles will be installed on doors.\nThroughout San Diego, a growing number of public buildings and streets are getting retrofitted as the city steps up spending to tackle a backlog of projects to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nSan Diego used to spend about $1.5 million a year on such projects. Now it\u2019s spending $10 million more per year on curb cuts, ramps, audible signals and detectable warning tiles at street intersections, among other improvements to remove barriers to access.\nMayor Jerry Sanders has committed to spending the additional $50 million over five years to improve access, in part by allocating proceeds from the sales of surplus city properties.\n\u201cBefore the mayor came into the office, we were just doing a trickle of projects. We are doing a lot of projects now,\u201d said David Jarrell, deputy chief operating officer for public works.\nAdvocates for the disabled said the improvements would help cut down the city\u2019s liability. Cities across the country have been sued for failure to improve access. San Diego was sued in 1997 by disabled residents who claimed they had been denied equal access to Qualcomm Stadium. The lawsuit was settled after the city agreed to spend $5.25 million to equip the stadium with new elevators, ramps, parking spaces and seating.\nBill Harris, a Sanders\u2019 spokesman, said the desire to do the right thing \u2013 not legal exposure \u2013 drove the mayor\u2019s commitment to ADA compliance. \u201cIt\u2019s not about avoiding litigation. It\u2019s about ensuring equal access,\u201d Harris said.\nAccording to the city, more than 500 curb ramps were installed in the past two years. About $19 million of projects are in design stages and an additional $4 million in jobs are under construction.\nFacilities being retrofitted range from police stations and recreation centers to branch libraries and teen centers.\nCindi Jones, director of the Center for an Accessible Society in San Diego, said improvements have been made, but the city still has a long way to go. She uses a scooter and her husband uses a wheelchair.\nIn South Park, where she and her husband have lived for 30 years, a curb cut was installed on their block about a year ago, Jones noted. She\u2019s looking forward to more curb cuts in her neighborhood.\nThe city\u2019s former disability services coordinator, Linda Woodbury, had said the city needed to spend $500 million on ADA compliance, but the mayor\u2019s office has disputed that figure. Woodbury was fired in 2006, a day after Sanders first proposed spending $50 million more on access projects. The city later settled a wrongful termination suit.\nLouis Frick, executive director of Access to Independence in San Diego, said the access features benefit society as a whole.\n\u201cYou see people all the time with baby strollers, delivery truck drivers, where they are using the curb cuts to get up and down the sidewalks,\u201d he said.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T06:27:18Z", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-1m27ada235845-city-taking-disabled-access-projects-2009feb27-story.html", "byte_size": 3292, "char_size": 3256}

{"text": "Anyone who has done a quick search on what to see in Norway certainly came across Preikestolen. It is one of the most popular hikes in the whole country. Not everyone experiences it the same way, however. Outdoor Life Norway is a guided service that offers guests a chance to see Pulpit Rock like most will never experience. The sunrise hike is an amazing way to up your chances of getting those stunning views without the crowds. If you truly want an original experience, though, go with their \"Off the beaten track\" tour. This hike begins with canoeing across a glacial lake to a long forgotten trail. Traverse the trail through multiple altitudinal zones and scramble up to the top of the fjord. There you can hike along until you reach your destination, a beautiful view of Preikestolen! There you can enjoy your view that majority of the hikers are missing. From there you will travel down to Pulpit Rock itself for some more photos. The trip down follows the more popular marked trail. If you are lucky enough, you may run into some of the Sherpas that have built the trails! If you're looking for more tours to fill up time in Norway, Outdoor Life Norway offers many guided services year round.\nThe land of fire and ice is an outdoor enthusiasts playground. Scuba diving in Silfra had been on my bucket list for years. It was a massive influence for me to get my PADI Open Water certification. Once I got my certification I remember my instructor asking me where I would go now that I could explore underwater paradises. I excitedly announced I'd be going to Iceland. He did not seem amused. \"Don't you want to start somewhere... warmer?\" I brushed off his remark as quickly as I whisked off my hood and booties. I had my mind made up. Silfra was my white whale and I finally had it in my headlights. When everything was booked, I was struck with panic. For years I had dreamed of Silfra, a place where you could swim between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. Would it be as spectacular as I had made it out to be?? Oh yes it was. The crystal clear glacial water is nearly ice cold and is filtered through lava creating over 300ft of visability. This quality of water means you can sip it while you're diving. It doesn't get fresher than that. Being able to say i've touched both continental plates at the same time in the only place in the world where you can dive directly in continental plate cracks is certainly bragging rights. I thought that would be the highlight of my cold swim in Silfra, but once I was in the water I forgot about the location. The dive was beyone beautiful with such distinct geographical features. The colors were jaw dropping. Though the dive itself was short, it's a dive that I could do over and over again. For those not scuba certified, many tour companies offer snorkeling excursions as well. Dive. Is. offers guests either option with photo services.\nIf you asked a stranger what came to mind when they thought of Iceland, volcanoes would make the list. This is definitely merited. The land has practically been completely molded by volcanic eruptions. If there's volcanoes you know there is lava, but Icelanders don't let it get them down. In fact, it gets them going. These hardened lava fields create the perfect backdrop for some serious mountain biking. These trails are not for the faint of heart. I may have overestimated my skills since I had been mountain biking in the past. I rated myself as an intermediate, which I quickly second guessed as soon as I saw people pull out their own peddles from perfectly packed Camelbaks. As nonchalantly as I could muster, I asked what the tour company's general client level was. My growing suspicion was confirmed. Most were season mountain bikers. I laughed in response to hide my surmounting fear. There was a good chance I may die in Iceland on a bicycle, I thought. There was worse ways to go I reasoned. It would make an interesting story, at least. Alas, I survived. Every part of my body may have hurt the next day, but something else was genuine as well. That was my smile. I signed up for a tour that I was not physically prepared for, but I did not regret it. It was a challenge that I overcame and I saw some stunning scenery along the way.\nFor those of you like me who are not expert mountain bikers, there are more appropriate tours to take. Icebike offers guests several options for different levels of experience. After seeing my lack of finesse in the lava fields, Icebike offered to take me to another location afterwards. I battled with my opposing feelings. Should I stick it out and do another lava field or should I opt for something different? The guide was very patient and genuinely wanted me to enjoy the experience that was right for me. I went with their recommendation. A part of me felt like a quitter until I saw the change of scenery. The lava fields were wild and otherworldly. The new scenery was as lush as if I had been plopped into Neverland itself. My bitter feelings instantly faded. Biking through the purple lupine fields was a magical end to a demanding day. My lesson of the day: Don't be afraid to try new things and have flexibility if they do not work out as perfectly as planned. My biking experience had more hiccups than I had predicted, but biking in Iceland was a once in a lifetime experience.\nUtah snow is world famous. In a location with pristine snow and more resorts than one can choose from, how does one... well, choose?? I struggled with the dilemma during a recent visit. I was down to my last day and I had only seen two resorts. I wanted to end with a bang without draining my bank account on a lift ticket. I gave up and resorted to asking my local friend for direction. \"You need to go to Sundance\". Sundance? I was baffled. This resort had barely made my radar. While I had pondered the pyramid hierarchy of ski resort awesomeness for days, it took my friend no time at all to respond to me.\"Not Snowbird or Park City?\" I bantered. Nope, he was firm. Well that settled my predicament. At the very least it would bring me some mental clarity since I no longer had to wrestle the decision.\nIf you go to Utah and don't visit Sundance Resort, you are doing it wrong. I immediately felt at home at this resort, as if I had been snowboarding there since I learned the difference between regular and goofy. In a world obsessed with modernizing everything, Sundance has made a point of preserving that nostalgic ski culture that we all love and miss. Okay, so the staff is nice. Is that a good enough reason to opt for Sundance over a larger resort? In retrospect, Sundance is one of the smaller resorts, but the views are not. I almost fell off the chairlift gawking at the scenery. From the base to the peak, every corner of the resort offered views that even Ansel Adams would have to stop and photograph. The character didn't stop at the lodge. The terrain kept me smiling from trail to trail. Feeling hungry? Stop at the peak for the most scenic nachos in the game. The Bearclaw Cabin is the only mountaintop lodge in Utah. If the sun is out, opt to sit outside in one of the zero gravity chairs. Sun and snow, can you beat it? If you want a resort with big hearts, big views, and a touch of home, you need to go to Sundance Resort.\nThe sunshine state usually cultivates images of lazy beach towns with a weird abundance of shaggy-haired surfers with names like \"Zander\" or \"Brock\". If you don't think of surfing, chances are you think of a retirement home paradise with every pm dinner special you could imagine. I am not here to knock your idea of Florida, because both scenes I just described exist in North Florida. I mean what's wrong with eating your food truck burrito while your barefoot at a reasonable time so hard to get on board with? You have time for dessert and digestion before you catch those zzz's! This is a battle meant for another day. If you aren't into shredding the gnar or attending senior bingo, you may wonder what Florida has to offer other than concrete amusement parks. Rejoice my friends because I have a solution. Though it may not be topping your vacation brochures, Florida offers great places for paddle sports. These sports can be enjoyed by any age group. Are you a seasoned kayaker looking for a challenge? Opt to try paddle boarding instead for a great core workout that perfects your balancing skills. Are you more into the outdoors just to get a tan? Select a tandem kayak and make your buddy do the brunt of the work. I know this because I've been the recipient of this. As I paddled with all my might in Norway and wondered why we weren't going faster, my friend Randy sat behind me happily snapping photos enjoying the fruits of my labor. I did not learn my lesson, however, since here I am recommending his devious plan to all of you. Just make sure your friend takes the front seat and doesn't read this passage. You're welcome.\nThe Aloha state is paradise: sunny, laid-back, umbrella drinking mai-tai kind of paradise. Though many people come here to do nothing more than read their book on the island's 30 miles of beaches, Maui can also be an adventure hot spot. I mean literally. The highest peak on the island is the world's largest dormant volcano. The impressive Haleakala volcano never ceases to draw in outdoor enthusiasts from around the globe. Want to feel like Hawaiian royalty? Opt to catch a mesmerizing sunrise from it's peak. Haleakala National Park offers guests more than just the star of the show. The park offers beach access but my favorite swimming spot of the entire Maui trip was dunking into the Seven Sacred Pools, or the Pools of 'Ohe'o. If mermaids emerged from the depths, I would have thought it perfectly normal. I loved being able to climb up to a series of the falls and sit under the cool,flowing water as I looked out at the ocean. Some pools are more popular and accessible than others. As I mentioned, the pools flowed into the Pacific so that contrast in scenery was fantastic. Pack a picnic to make a great day of pool adventures. Swimming does not get more exotic than this. After you have your fill of swimming, continue hiking through Haleakala National Park to dry off. Your efforts will be rewarded when you reach a stunning bamboo forest. You may think you accidentally arrived on another continent with the landscape change.\nHaleakala is not to be missed and you can access it off of the famous Road to Hana. The road itself merits a few days to explore. Opt for a convertible so you can soak up as much roadside scenery as you can. If you are still craving big views, end your trip with a cherry on top. A helicopter tour of Maui may not be the most physical tour you can do, but I promise you will be feeling the adrenaline. The tour gives you access to views you would never be able to see otherwise. Get close to peaks and waterfalls alike. The views are breathtaking and you may just get the feeling that you are about to be dropped off in Jurassic Park.\nI can never be satisfied with doing everything just like everyone else. If I am going to a stereotypical tourist spot. I need to have an element that is different. While doing my research for antelope canyon, I found just what I was looking for to satisfy my stubborn self. Hidden Canyon Kayak was Arthur and the day trip through Antelope Canyon was my sword in the stone. At first I was a bit disappointed to see how large my group size was. In the past I have been spoiled with much smaller guide to tourist ratios in my travels. Once in the water, however, the problem dispersed as quickly as waves off my boat. The guides were good at accomodating people of all ability levels. As a frequent kayaker, I had a much faster pace than most. The guides recognized this, and made sure I did not feel restrained. Once we reached antelope canyon, we were released to explore the slot canyon on our own to a certain point. Again, I was happy to hear this since I much preferred being alone than attached to families I didn't know. It was a thrill to be able to skip, run, and even sing if I wanted to down these beautiful corridors. I loved this tour and would recommend it to anyone. The guides were relatable and I enjoyed my time talking to them. My only recommendation is if you are an experienced kayaker, let the guides know ahead of time and they will bring you a touring kayak. Compared to my kayak at home, the kayak I was given made me feel like I was moving through mud. Avoid this and request a more efficient boat. They just don't like to assign them to someone who is not experienced and has a higher chance to tip the narrow boats.\nHave you ever thought that mountain biking is cool, but it would be so much cooler to bike on Mars? I can't say i've been on this train of thought before, someone out there has been. To them I say, Mars is too far away. Sure you can keep fantasizing about the day that Richard Branson and Elon Musk unite like superheroes and create martian colonies complete with lotteries to fuel us basic humans with dreams of dual planet citizenship. Okay, maybe I have thought of this before. I digress. Biking in Page, Arizona may be the closest alternative. Really, the place is out of this world! So aren't my puns. Accessible right from town, I was told by a local to check out the Rimview trail. I stopped at a local shop, Lake Powell Paddleboards, and rented a mountain bike. A quick overview of a map and a heeding message of \"there are parts of the trail that if you get hurt or can't finish, no one can come get you\"and I was off. A little skeptical of my skill after my warning, I wasn't sure how my day would go. Quickly into the trail, my reservations disappeared. It was easy to with the beautiful desert landscape. The \"rimview\" gets its name for a very specific reason. In parts you were on the very edge of the trail with a steep drop off. If it got too hairy, I simply walked. It was my best option since I was alone and if I got hurt, I didn't want to think of the desolate potential situation. The views of Lake Powell were breathtaking. What blew me away was that I had the trail virtually to myself. In a busy tourist town, I came across only two people my whole time biking. The two people were locals at that. It was my escape from vacation. A step away to truly take in a place. This was not without hard work, however. The trail had its difficult moments and was best suited for at least intermediate riders. If you are new, you at least have the ability to walk any dangerous spots. The heat is also draining. A lot of water and snacks for energy are a must. I can honestly say my lunch was well earned this day.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T20:19:10Z", "url": "http://eatsandfeats.blogspot.com/p/feats.html", "byte_size": 14691, "char_size": 14691}

{"text": "Alternating between a woman\u2019s childhood in a small town and as an adult in the city, this novel traces a Jehovah Witness family\u2019s splintering belief system, their isolation, and the erosion of their relationships. As Emily becomes closer to her closeted Uncle Tyler, she begins to challenge her upbringing. Her questions about the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 insular lifestyle, rigid codes of conduct, and tenets of their faith haunt her older sister Lenora too. When Lenora disappears, everything changes and Emily becomes obsessed with taking on her sister\u2019s identity, believing that Lenora is controlling her actions. Ultimately, Emily finds release through self-mutilation.\nI loved everything about this book. I am quickly becoming a fan of ECW Press as they publish quality and unexpected gems like this one. The book intrigued me from the beginning as who hasn`t had a Jehovah`s Witness come to their door and I did know a bit about their faith so I thought this would be an interesting somewhat inside (although fictional) look into what it would be like to be part of them.\nThe main character, Emily, was wise beyond her years in some ways yet so sheltered in others. The story goes between past and present and the present left me feeling somewhat unbalanced yet wanting to know more. I loved the way that the story flowed and kept me intrigued to know more and eventually figure out what was going on. The parts from the present were much less straightforward than the parts set in the past so at times I found myself somewhat confused but eventually I got that this was probably also a facet of her mindset. The author was able to create two very distinct personalities in the same character and you could clearly see the changes that time and circumstance had wrought on Emily.\nThe story was not conventional by any means and that as definitely part of its appeal to me. Not only was Emily raised as a Jehovah`s Witness, there was also her closeted uncle and her rebellious sister that added their own personal elements to the story.\nI am definitely looking forward to the next novel by Jennifer as I cannot imagine what she could possibly write to top this one but I am sure that based on her fantastic descriptions and the very fact that she was able to come up with something so interesting that she will find a way to.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T19:58:52Z", "url": "http://www.novelescapes.com/2014/02/watch-how-we-walk-by-jennifer-lovegrove.html", "byte_size": 2337, "char_size": 2327}

{"text": "My brother mentioned that Mother Dear asked for me by name when I was away. I hadn't seen her in almost a week. I wonder if she noticed I hadn't been around or if it was just something that crossed her mind like when she says she needs to find her parents.\nI guess she was good last Friday but not so good on Sunday when my brother visited.

{"text": "For decades Fern\u00e1ndez had been recognized and honored for his accomplishments in the world of music. But up until October 11, 1991, no one had ever declared that as a singer, Fern\u00e1ndez was on equal footing with perhaps the greatest singer in American pop history.\nIn a career spanning five decades, Fern\u00e1ndez has been awarded every honor and accolade in the entertainment world and beyond. He has won Grammys and Premio Lo Nuestro awards. He\u2019s regularly topped the charts in Billboard and has been recognized with lifetime achievement awards, hall of fame honors and even a star on Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame.\nWith his trademark charro outfit, wide sombrero and impeccable backing mariachi ensemble, he has performed on the world\u2019s biggest and most prestigious stages. He has headlined Mexico City\u2019s Auditorio Nacional and the Plaza de Toros Mexico to New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall.\nMany considered Fern\u00e1ndez to be Mexico\u2019s fourth gallo, or singing rooster.\nThe other three are considered the greatest all-time singers in Mexico. But they all died young \u2013 Jorge Negrete at 42 in 1953, Pedro Infante at 39 in 1957 and Javier Solis at 34 in 1966. It was into this profound artistic void that Fern\u00e1ndez stepped in 1966.\nFor more than 40 years, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez has maintained his standing as Mexico\u2019s greatest living singer, coupling an operatic range with a deep understanding of ranchera music\u2019s rural roots. Through the years he inspired hundreds of imitators, but none could ever match his operatic power and range. In the dozens of Mexican movies he starred in, Fern\u00e1ndez often played a role that suited him perfectly-that of the proud charro, or Mexican cowboy.\nAs a world-class singer, Fern\u00e1ndez always combines impeccable musicianship, provocative songs and his great vocals to deliver unforgettable performances. He was and continues to be prolific, influential, and ultimately a critical player responsible for shaping the growth and development of the modern ranchera genre. For his artistic integrity, his tireless dedication, and unending enthusiasm, Fern\u00e1ndez will be noted in history books as one of the fundamental and influential pioneers of ranchera music and a towering figure in the evolution of Regional Mexican music.\nHis towering discography comprises over 100 albums. He\u2019s influential in the way that he\u2019s shaped the growth and development of ranchera music. Through the hundreds of songs that feature his voice, Fern\u00e1ndez is certain to be the associated of Mexican pride and artistry around the world.\nHe entered a singing contest in Guadalajara when he was 14, and won first place. That win gave him the confidence to start performing in restaurants and weddings.\nIn early 1963, his mother, Paula G\u00f3mez de Fern\u00e1ndez, died of cancer at the age of 47. Later that year, on December 27, he married Mar\u00eda del Refugio \u201cCuquita\u201d Abarca Villase\u00f1or, his neighbor in Guadalajara. The couple would go on to have four children: Vicente, Gerardo, Alejandro and Alejandra.\nWorking to further his career, Fern\u00e1ndez, then 24, was tapped as vocalist by two of Guadalajara\u2019s best mariachis \u2013 Mariachi Amanecer de Pepe Mendoza and Mariachi de Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Aguilar. Through his work with these groups, he was introduced to Felipe Arriaga. During that time he performed regularly on the mariachi-themed radio program titled Amanecer Tapat\u00edo (Guadalajara Morning). Soon, Arriaga and other influential friends convinced him to move to Mexico City, Mexico\u2019s political, business and cultural capital.\nBy late 1965, Fern\u00e1ndez was pitching himself to the major labels based in the city. He was always turned down, but he began hanging around CBS Studios in hopes of landing an audition. Eventually Fern\u00e1ndez got his foot in the door at XEX, the clear-channel AM powerhouse known as the most listened-to radio station in Mexico. XEX exposed him to a nationwide audience.\nNot content to just make records and perform live, Fern\u00e1ndez also branched out into movies. His first film was Uno y Medio Contra el Mundo. Three years later, he had his first hit starring role in La Ley del Monte. The movie\u2019s title song was also a hit for Fern\u00e1ndez. Among his successful albums of the early 1970s were El Rey, El Hijo del Pueblo, and Para Recordar. He was building a body of work that would showcase his expressive voice and define modern mariachi music.\nBy 1975, Fern\u00e1ndez was admired by mariachi fans, but he wasn\u2019t yet an iconic figure. But that was soon to change. In 1976, the composer Fernando Z. Maldonado wrote a different kind of ranchera. A ranchera about a macho guy who accepts his guilt in a failed relationship. It was a new theme, and it struck a nerve: \u201cVolver, Volver\u201d became a ranchera anthem. An incorrigible ladies\u2019 man, Fern\u00e1ndez personified the protagonist of the song. It was a magical combination of music, lyrics and voice. By the end of 1976, \u201cVolver, Volver\u201d had broken sales records and was being played from cars, houses and jukeboxes all over the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, Fern\u00e1ndez was unquestionably an international star.\nBetween recording and touring Fern\u00e1ndez carved out a place for his family. In 1980 he built a 1,250-acre ranch near Guadalajara, called Los Tres Potrillos (The Three Fillys) in honor of his three sons. Surrounded by an irrigation canal, the ranch has the feeling of a cocoon.\nEntering his fourth decade of recording, in the 1990s, Fern\u00e1ndez continued to add to his canon of classics with hits like \u201cAunque me Duela el Alma\u201d (1995), \u201cMe Voy a Quitar de En Medio\u201d (1998), and \u201cLa Mentira\u201d (1998), the theme song of the popular ranch-centered telenovela. He garnered a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted into Billboard\u2019s Hall of Fame.\nOn September 17, 2002, he was named Person of the Year by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the producers of the Latin Grammys. The honor paid tribute to his artistic achievements and his support of the National Hispanic Scholarship Fund. Never forgetting his humble roots, Fern\u00e1ndez also remembers his fans who live in small towns and isolated areas of Mexico, performing free shows at country fairs.\nAs a singer, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez is at the top of his game. The proof is in his recent achievements, which more typically resemble those of a young, rising star than someone who\u2019s been recording and touring for over 40 years.\nIn 2006, after three years away from the recording studio, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez released his comeback album La Tragedia Del Vaquero (The Tragedy of the Cowboy), featuring 14 brand-new songs. A keepsake and instant classic in the mariachi music canon.\nAlso in 2006, in preparation for Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s 40th anniversary as a recording artist \u2013 Sony Music released a three-CD collection of his greatest hits, titled The Living Legend (\u2018La Leyenda Viviente\u2019). Containing 35 classics, along with the new song \u201cMe Quedan Todas,\u201d this collectors\u2019 \u00edtem was avidly sought out by fans in the U.S. and Mexico. Regional Mexican and Latin pop radio, meanwhile, sent \u201cMe Quedan Todas\u201d to the top of the airplay charts.\nFor 2007, his official 40th-anniversary year, El Rey embarked on one of the biggest Latin-music tours in U.S. history. And he returned with another exciting new studio album \u2013 Para Siempre, which within three months of its release was certified RIAA Double Platinum (Latin) in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The album\u2019s first single \u201c\u00c9stos Celos\u201d spent over three months at No. 1 on the principal Regional Mexican airplay charts. The song finished the year as the most-played Regional Mexican song of 2007 in the U.S., while Para Siempre received a nomination for Best Ranchera Album at the 2008 Grammys.\nThe success of Para Siempre continued with its title track. It was the principal song for Televisa\u2019s blockbuster telenovela \u201cFuego en la Sangre,\u201d which has produced the network\u2019s highest ratings ever.\nIn 2008, his achievements became even more impressive with the release of his live CD/DVD Primera Fila, which was the top-selling musical DVD of the year in the U.S. in any genre. He won a Latin Grammy in fall 2008, and in 2009 continued his awards-season streak with a Premio Lo Nuestro and a Billboard Latin Music Award.\nStaying at the forefront of mariachi music, he released his latest studio album, Necesito de Ti (I Need You), in July 2009, as the title-track first single climbed the charts.\nIn order to enshrine his love and admiration for horses, for country life and for music, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez in 2005 built the Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez G\u00f3mez Arena for Performances and Horsemanship. This 11,000-capacity area is located on his Los Tres Potrillos (Three Fillys) ranch outside Guadalajara. Ultra-modern and completely enclosed, the facility is popular for rodeos, sporting events and concerts. In 2005 it was the site of the LXI Congress and Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez National Charro Championship.\nAs the 2010s dawned, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez remained ubiquitous, prolific and always interesting. He wrapped up the 2000s with the December 2009 re-release of Necesito de Ti in CD+DVD configuration, featuring 13 audio and video tracks. It earned Platinum certification in Mexico, and Gold in the U.S.\nOne of most the most important Latin albums of 2009, Necesito de Ti received multiple recognitions for its quality and popularity. Mexico\u2019s Premios Oye awarded him three trophies in November 2009. In 2010, Necesito de Ti was awarded the American Grammy for Best Ranchera Album. Later in the year, he also won Univision\u2019s Premio Lo Nuestro for Ranchera Artist of the Year, and two Billboard Latin Music Awards.\nDipping into the plentiful well of Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s greatest moments, Sony Music in 2010 released Un Mexicano en la Mexico, a DVD of his iconic September 15, 1984, concert at Mexico City\u2019s Plaza de Toros bullring. There, he performed to a standing-room only crowd of 54,000 for over two hours as rain continually threatened to dampen the proceedings. But, legend has it, none other than the Aztec god Tlaloc kept the showers at bay, setting the stage for a historic performance.\nRight back on the scene with another groundbreaking studio album, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez in September 2010 released El Hombre Que M\u00e1s Te Am\u00f3 (The Man Who Loved You Most). Despite having nothing to prove, Fern\u00e1ndez still made a major step forward, serving as producer for the first time in his career and tapping the talents of young, aspiring songwriters. Quite a risk, but the results speak for themselves \u2013 El Hombre Que M\u00e1s Te Am\u00f3 won the 2011 Latin Grammy for Best Ranchera Album.\nVicente Fern\u00e1ndez is still the most popular singer, not just in the ranchera genre, but in all of Regional Mexican music.\nWith a tremendous and still-growing discography, a powerful voice and unforgettable music, Fern\u00e1ndez pushes the boundaries of mariachi music and influences absolutely everybody. His longevity, his dedication to his craft and his faithful devotion to his fans make him beloved in Mexico and around the world.\nAs a pioneer, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez is to Mexican music what Hank Williams is to country, B.B. King is to blues and Woody Guthrie is to folk.\nIn 2011, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez outdoes himself again with Otra Vez (Once Again), released in November. Recording took place in the Mexican states of Jalisco and Morelos at studios belonging to Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez himself and those of his producer Joan Sebastian. A collaboration of virtuosos, Otra Vez marks the second time that Joan Sebastian has produced El Rey \u2013 thus the title! Joan Sebastian also wrote all of the songs on Otra Vez.\nWe enjoy a rhythmic treat on first single \u201cVolcanes Dormidos\u201d (Sleeping Volcanoes), which finds Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez incorporating electric guitar into his ranchera music for the first time. It\u2019s a beguiling fusion, and one that only maestros like Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez and Joan Sebastian could pull off.\nSo once again \u2013 Otra Vez \u2013 we salute Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, who is synonymous with studio perfection, vocal passion and an inimitable style. Like fine wine, he improves with the years. And he is a maestro for every aspiring artist.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T17:04:14Z", "url": "https://vicentefernandez.mx/en/biography/", "byte_size": 12231, "char_size": 12060}

{"text": "The third phase of punitive import duties being imposed upon goods of Chinese origin \u2013 published last night - does NOT include original works of art, collectables, antiques, or photographs (HTSUS Chapters 97 and 49). This is good news for our industry and will allow most within the artworld to continue business as normal.\nPlease note that some contemporary works of art may fall into other categories not specified above.\nMany articles of furniture covered under Chapter 69 and 94 of the HTSUS commodities code are on the list of regulated items. Those items include ceramics, lamps, seats, couches, mattresses, chandeliers, etc. In addition to current duty rates you can expect an immediate additional duty of 10 % on such items, possibly jumping to 25 % at the beginning of 2019.\nIt is important to contact your Dietl International Representative early to discuss and confirm the duty/tax implications of all your imports \u2013 especially if goods of Chinese origin are included in your shipments.\n1) The punitive import duties are being implemented in 3 stages (Tranches).\nThe 1st tranche (effective July 6th) - and the 2nd tranche - (effective August 23rd) - do NOT include original works of art, antiques and photographs.\nThere are no Chapter 49 (photographs), 94 (furniture) or 97 (original art & collectibles & antiques) commodities listed under this Tranche.\n2) While Chapter 97 commodities are currently on the list for consideration, we do not know what commodities will end up on the final list or when third Tranche will go into effect.\nAt the direction of President Trump, the USTR is also reviewing a third list (or tranche) of products imported from China to the U.S. worth an additional $200B. The USTR is considering whether to impose tariffs of 10% or possibly 25% on that list of products. The comment period on that list ends September 6th. There is no indication in any public record of how soon after the end of comment period the final list will be determined and published, and when the additional tariffs will go into effect. At present, importation of art of Chinese origin will not be subject to the 25% tariff until mid to late September.\n3) If Chapter 97 remains in the final list of published commodities for the 3rd tranche it will affect ALL works of Chinese Origin, regardless of where they are shipped from. If you decide to move inventory of Chinese origin from Europe to the US, you will still have to pay the 25 % import duty. Thus, you may want to consider returning any inventory you own to the US within the next month.\n4) As part of the proposed tariff, the use of a foreign trade zone will not defer the additional 25% tariff on commodities.\n\"To ensure the effectiveness of the action, any merchandise subject to the increased tariffs admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone on or after the effective date of the increased tariffs, except those eligible for admission under \u201cdomestic status\u201d as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, would have to be admitted as \u201cprivileged foreign status\u201d as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and would be subject upon entry for consumption to the additional duty.\"\nPlease note the following information is based on current import regulations and dependent upon your individual shipping requirements, all information is subject to change. Please contact Dietl with any questions.\na) TIB - Import under a \"Temporary Import Bond\". The TIB is good for a period of 1 year and can be renewed in yearly increments up to 3 years.\nAnything imported under TIB \"MUST\" be re-exported. If you fail to re-export any goods covered under TIB, you will pay a penalty of 2x (2 times) the duty amount - which in this case would be 75 % of the value!!!\nb) Temporary import using a Carnet ATA. All works have to leave after the exhibition. Carnets are generally good for a period of 1 year - with some exceptions. China allows only 6 months.\nc) Pay the import duties upon arrival and apply for a \"duty drawback\" upon re-export. It will tie up some cash, but you will be able to sell work off the wall. Of course, the 25 % import duty will probably make it difficult to sell any Chinese works to serious collectors going forward.\nThe drawback is a lengthy process and it can take up to 1 year to receive the refund for 99 % of the duties you paid for the returned property from the date of export.\nFor detailed costs pertaining to \"duty drawback\" upon re-export, please contact your Dietl representative.\nWe will continue to monitor the situation and of course keep you informed the moment we obtain additional relevant information.\nNEW YORK and LOS ANGELES, July 31, 2018 \u2500 ATL Partners (\u201cATL\u201d) announced today that it has acquired a majority stake in Rock-It Cargo USA LLC, the parent company of Dietl International.

And sea-legged visitors to Key West can enjoy the best of both worlds aboard Breezin, a 42-foot Catalina sloop that offers full- (seven hours) and half-day (four hours) charters on the balmy surrounding waters.\nBut what really sets Breezin apart from the competition is her skipper, Dennis Krinitt. We first met \u201cCaptain Dees\u201d about a decade ago, when he worked for a nearby sailing charter company. While that all-day snorkel excursion was everything we\u2019d hoped for, it was the smart, good-natured, soft-spoken Krinitt \u2013 whose conversation shifted from jazz standards to Tom Robbins to basic seamanship as naturally as the changing tide \u2013 that really shone. And despite his credentialed profession, the native Californian may well be the most productive-yet-chill human being I\u2019ve ever met: calm, collected, unflappable.\nSo impressed were we by Captain Dees that we went out with him again before that trip was up. And thereafter, on each return to Key West, we made a point of booking only those trips he was scheduled to helm, including one sunset cruise on which Captain Dees \u2013 also a licensed notary \u2013 officiated our renewed wedding vows.\nEventually, Captain Dees landed Breezin a slip in the Key West Bight Marina, at the foot of William Street, where he now offers sailing charters, lessons, sunset cruises, and more.

{"text": "Are you thinking about using online assignment help platforms? If you answered yes, then you are definitely not alone. This service is increasing in popularity across the globe. It makes it easier for students to handle their school requirements. But the nature of the service remains shrouded in controversy. After all, teachers and professors give out assignments for a reason. They are meant to boost the skills of students both inside and outside the classroom. This begs the question: Do assignment help services benefit or hurt students?\nIt\u2019s easy to see the benefits of hiring assignments experts to aid in your academic pursuits. They solve the problem of insufficient time to do homework\u2019s, especially if you take on multiple part-time jobs after school hours. As you know, writing essays or completing complicated assignments can take up a boatload of time. Between gathering information and adding the final touches, your assignment can take several hours to finish.\nThe speed with which you can finish your assignments with the help of service providers like the guys at Do My Assignments is another huge benefit. Most companies accept expedited requests for an extra fee. It\u2019s possible to get your paper or assignment in as little as 24 hours. While these aforementioned benefits are surely hard to resist, it\u2019s worth noting that using assignment writing services offers more than meets the eye.\nAt first, it might not appear to make sense that hiring assignment help providers can improve your research skills. You don\u2019t even need to research about anything. They will do everything for you, and this is where you can get tips from the experts.\nBy looking at the final output of the assignment expert, you could see how much it differs from the homework\u2019s you have done yourself. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise if these differences are very noticeable. You could tell that time and effort has been dedicated to producing such a well-researched assignment. Even the references and links can help you with your future requirements, as you would see how much more credible your work will look like if the links aren\u2019t limited to Wikipedia.\nThe same applies to your presentation skills. The way the essay, research paper, or assignment is formatted can give you ideas on how to better structure your content. Notice how the ideas flow smoothly throughout, allowing you to get the point across even without the use of fancy words. You probably have a \u201cgo-to\u201d format for your essays, but you\u2019ll realize that it doesn\u2019t always work.\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss assignment writing services as only for lazy students who do not care at all about learning. But it\u2019s important to understand that the students can enjoy much more than its time-saving benefits. With the help of experts, you can pick up some tips on how to research about a topic, what credible sources to use, and how to present your ideas in a way that engages readers.

{"text": "A while back I asked you to send me in any questions that you are looking for an answer to and I received well over 100 responses. So, I\u2019ve hand-picked just four to answer today and I'll come back to the others in the future. On with the questions!\nMar 17 Time in the market is your money\u2019s best friend.\nI interviewed a bloke for an upcoming episode of my podcast and he had a lot to say about investing in individual shares and why he used to buy them, but now no longer does. He took the advice of a good friend when she told him, back in the 1980s, just buy into today\u2019s equivalent of an index fund and let time in the market be your money\u2019s best friend. Low and behold, she was correct.\nWhen I realised that in order to become an investor I didn\u2019t have to learn how to pick stocks it was like the clouds had parted and the sun had finally come out. And I have American John C. Bogle to thank for that. Last week he passed away at the age of 89 but he leaves a huge legacy behind and I know that in years to come many will still be learning from him, just like I did.\nThe Barefoot Investor by Australian Scott Pape is an excellent book and it has been instrumental in changing the financial direction of not just Australians but also of Kiwis. Many people have asked me to work out what the Kiwi equivalents are of the providers he recommends. I\u2019m not saying this is a conclusive list, but I\u2019ve given it my best shot.\nThis question was sent in by Declan a while back, but it is one that crops up in my inbox relatively consistently as well, so I thought back to what I did and what I would do if faced with the situation he is proposing again.\nRecently I had an excellent question from a fellow Happy Saver who had been comparing SmartShares, SuperLife and Sharesies, not so much to find the lowest fees, but to work out which has the smoothest and easiest system and which one allowed him to purchase shares in the fastest time.\nThe very first thing I would do is set up an automatic transfer to syphon off a set amount of money each week into a sub account with your bank and give it a flash name like \u201cIKMSMOI\u201d (investments keep my sticky mitts off it).\nTwo weeks ago I was giving away a book The Simple Path To Wealth by JL Collins and in order to win it I asked you to send me an email telling me the most simple strategy you have devised so far to get yourself ahead financially. I was flooded with suggestions and I thought that they were just too good not to share.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T06:34:50Z", "url": "https://www.thehappysaver.com/blog/tag/SuperLife", "byte_size": 2494, "char_size": 2476}

{"text": "We mention self-determination because it is an issue elsewhere that was witnessed by the disintegration of the United Soviet Socialist Republics. States such as Kazakhstan, Armenia, Georgia, Latvia, Ukraine and others sought to stand on their own and ponder their future. And they are making strides in their own humble way.\nIn South Sudan the 30 year political marriage was fought along national and religious lines. Those in the north are Arab and Islamic while those in the south, the new state, are African and Christian. Keeping them together proved to be a recipe for disaster.\nOne of the worthy sons of the African soil, former President Thabo Mvuyelwa Mbeki, was the main \u201cmidwife\u201d in the delivery room of this new born baby. We owe much to this African despite some having tried to downplay is effort to the extent of boasting about clipping is wings so that he could not deliver on the assignment. There is no doubt that Mbeki is wont to live his African dream and has to be supported as much as he has to be commended for a job well done.\nIndependence should of course not be treated like a Christmas party. Just like a funeral or a wedding, on the day of the occasion there are so many people that those involved hardly have anywhere to sleep of move but soon after the guests have left, the celebration over, the hosts are left to their destitution again. In independence the nation has to be fed, infrastructure has to be provided, governance has to be in place and above all peace is expected to reign. In South Sudan that is not the case as there are issues to sort out such as borders, their armies are still facing off against each other. The oil-rich province is the main bone of contention.\nThe call by Baleka Mbete, the national chairperson of the African National Congress, has to be supported. That country needs help and expertise to get it going. If South Africa is to lend a hand, we hope a South Africans of goodwill will be engaged.\nIt should not be a matter of only those in the majority party who are deployed there. We support Mbete\u2019s call that all those involved in whatever sector of business, be it manufacturing, mining, agriculture and technology should not be shy to establish themselves in that new country.\nLet us pray much the strength of Mbeki for his fortitude and the work that still lies ahead such as finding solutions to the serious outstanding issues. We hope the South African government will rise above their myopic and jaundiced judgment by making resources available to him as the success he achieves falls on the government to bask in.\nPresident Jacob Zuma should, as he promised on the occasion of the celebration of the South Sudanese independence, ensure that the infant state will be assisted to stand on its own feet lest the international communities make us a laughing stork.\nWe cross our fingers and hope this nation will grow to take its rightful place among other nations of the world.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T18:21:14Z", "url": "http://www.ucdp.org.za/jit_default_1174.html", "byte_size": 2953, "char_size": 2947}

{"text": "Global Sleeping Aids Market size is projected to be valued $96 Billion by 2024; with a CAGR of 6.2% from 2017 to 2025. Sleeping aids are medical specialty or subspecialty devoted to the diagnosis and therapy of sleep disturbances and disorders which are caused due to factors such as psychiatric disorders (Depression, insomnia and anxiety), medical issues (asthma), environmental problems (light, noise, temperature etc.) and others. These sleep disorders lead to number of chronic diseases, such as high diabetes, arthritis, blood pressure, and stroke. So, people are now aware of these disorders and trying to treat and diagnose these disorders at an early stage as soon as possible.\nRise in demand for sleeping pills, changing consumer lifestyle, increase in geriatric and obese population, and increasing disposable income are the factors propelling the growth of the global sleeping aids market. Rising awareness about sleeping disorders and advanced technologies might provide with several growth opportunities in the forecasted year. However, various side effects of sleep aids medication and patent expiration may hinder the growth of the market.\nThe global sleeping aids market is segmented on basis of product and sleep disorder. The sleeping aids market is segmented by product as mattresses and pillows, sleep laboratories, medication (prescription based drugs, herbal drugs, OTC drugs), sleep apnea devices and others. Further, the market is segmented by sleep disorder as insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, sleep walking, and other sleep disorders.\nBased on geography, global sleeping aids market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Rest of the World (RoW) North America is further bifurcated in U.S., Canada, and Mexico whereas Europe segment consist of UK, Germany, France, Italy, and others.

{"text": "Long sofas, also called \u201cfixed sofas\u201d, are a real passepartout for the furniture of the living room.\nSurely, the most popular long sofa is the tree-seater, which is a compact and functional \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d solution, ideal in order to furnish open-spaces, small living rooms or wider rooms, where there are already coffee tables, poufs, footrests or a combined two-seater. This latter is a versatile small sofa, which can perfectly complete a lounge but also different domestic contexts. In fact, it can create a trendy waiting area near the entrance or a comfortable relax zone within the bedroom.\nThe properly modern long sofas have deep seats, quite low backrests, reduced volumes and textured coverings in the most elegant and natural chromatic shades.\nClassic fixed sofas, instead, have most generous volumes, soft and sinuous lines, refined pillows, rounded armrests and sumptuous covering fabrics. Both typologies can be found within Divanidea catalogue of long sofas: a colourful collection of new padded and upholstered furniture, where you will find modern sofas, minimal models or evergreen icons.\nDo you need an example? Kline: the modern sofa with armrests extremely comfortable, completed with inclinable backrests and footrests, activated by safe relax mechanisms.\nOn the other hand, between the classic models, it is a duty to mention Positano, the elegant and luxurious long sofa which can meet also modern tastes, thanks to the innovative bed version.\nDespite those furnishing solutions, substantially modern or traditional, within the Divanidea collection of fixed sofas can be found also eclectic and creative models, with a bold and unedited look, such as Gogo: the peculiar foldable backrests of this sofa will change the entire conformation and shape of the piece of furniture.\nWhat\u2019s more, you will find models with high or low supporting feet, wide or narrow armrests, customizable with regard to fabrics and leathers, but always comfortable and soft.

{"text": "In the second book of the Harry Potter Series, \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets\u201d by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter finds out that he can communicate with snakes using the Parseltongue language.\nIn this challenge we will write a Python script to translate English to Parseltongue and vice-versa.\nTo encode a message into Parseltongue you need to insert the string sequence \u201csss\u201d between each character of your message. e.g.\nI can speak to snakes using Parseltongue.\nTo decode a message from Parseltongue remove the \u201csss\u201d character sequences by only keeping 1 character out of 4 from the encoded message.\nCheck the following code, which uses two subroutines (functions) called encode() and decode() to encode a message in Parseltongue or decode a message from Parseltongue. Both functions use a technique called string concatenation to add one letter at a time to the message or cypher being generated.\nDid you know? Encoding and decoding secret messages is a key application of Computer Science called cryptography. An encoded message is called a cipher.\nAs a wizard at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, Harry Potter often needs to decipher secret messages. In this set of challenges you will write Python subroutines to encode or decode secret messages using a range of techniques.\nThe Parseltongue coding technique described above is not very secure. It would be easy for anyone to look at a cipher text and to be able to find a way to decipher it without being told how to in the first instance.\nTo make this encryption technique more secure we will adapt the encode() function implemented in the trinket above. Instead of adding the string \u201csss\u201d after each character we will add three random letters.\nBy completing this challenge, we are going to learn how to use ASCII code when manipulating strings.\nYou will use the chr() and ord() python instructions to convert characters into ASCII code and vice versa.\nprint(chr(97)) would display the letter \u201ca\u201d on screen as 97 is the ASCII code for character \u201ca\u201d.\nprint(ord(\u201ca\u201d)) would display the 97 on screen as 97 is the ASCII code for character \u201ca\u201d.\nUse this code to tweak the the encode() function. The decode() function should not need to be updated and should still work with this new encryption technique.\nTest your code. Do you find the cipher text to be more secure?\nUsing this encryption techniques the cipher message is based on the actual message with the letters of the message appearing in reverse order. e.g.\nUsing this encryption technique, the same function can be used to both encode and decode a message.\nYour task is to implement one function used to encode/decode a message, applying the \u201cReversi formula\u201d.\nCreate two new functions to encode and decode two messages at the same time by intertwining each letter of these messages. Your encode() function will take two parameters, message1 and message2, and generate a cipher by intertwining each letter of both messages, one letter at a time.\nIn cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as shift cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the message to encrypt is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.\nYou will find out more about this technique by following this link.\nCan you think of any other approach you could use to encrypt a message? You may combine several of the techniques listed above, as combining several techniques will make your cipher more difficult to decode hence it will be a lot more secure!", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T22:44:21Z", "url": "https://www.101computing.net/parseltongue-encoder/", "byte_size": 3589, "char_size": 3553}
{"text": "Here in Australia, Boxing Day is our \"Black Friday.\" It's the day after Christmas Day and stores have massive sales to help get rid of any post Christmas stock. While it's been a huge event for our department stores for many years, online shopping has made grabbing a bargain much easier (with the added benefit of not having to battle people for the last gift box!).\nAdelaide has no Mecca Maxima stores, so I had to order the Urban Decay Gwen Stefani Eyeshadow Palette from Mecca online. While this has been available for a while in the US, it was only released on Boxing Day here.\nI'm IN LOVE with this palette. I feel like it was made for me. I know a lot of people have said there's not much in the way of colour selection, but for someone pale it's the perfect palette.\nIt retails for $95 here in Australia so it's pricier than the other palettes that UD sell, but you really see the amount of thought that went into both the palette and the packaging and shade names.\nThe packaging is gorgeous although it's quite heavy. I can't wait for the rest of the UD x Gwen collection to be released.\nLipstick Republic is an Australian online store that sells brands like Sigma, OCC, Lime Crime, Jeffrey Star, Morphe and more. They had 25% off so I put in an order for some products that were on my wishlist.\nI have previously ordered a Benjabelle Brush Tree from them and I wanted to buy another one. I already have the Mini Brush Tree, which holds 24 eye brushes but I wanted to get a large brush tree that also holds large brushes. I decided on the Sunflower Brush Tree as it holds both small and large brushes.\nI also ordered the spinner bottom as I don't have it on my other brush tree and I wanted to see if it was more helpful while washing my brushes.\nI've never been one for Sigma brushes (youTubers pushing their code down my throat makes me side eye the company) but I received a mini E25 Blending Brush in a Bellabox previously and I really loved it, so I ordered a fullsize one from their copper line. I also ordered the Sigma E45 Small Tapered Blending Brush as you can never have enough blending brushes. I thought that this would be great for me as I have small eyes and some blending brushes are bigger than my eyes!!\nAnd finally I ordered the Barely Cosmetics Definer Soft Sponge to apply my foundation. I like the shape of this. I haven't tried this yet. I can't wait to see how it compares to my beauty blender and RT sponge.\nI love Soda & Co's Instagram page of their natural body products and lipbalms. Their packaging is super cute and I love their pictures. When I saw that they had 30% off, I decided to finally make an order.\nBecause I haven't tried their products before, I decided to buy a pack that includes a body wash, body lotion and a sugar scrub that's in an adorable cosmetics bag.\nI struggled with which scent to choose from (pink lemonade, mint burst or orange splash) but finally decided on pink lemonade as I was worried that the others would smell like bathing in toothpaste or orange juice.\nI've been using them and the body lotion is the stand out for me. It feels thick when I put it onto my skin but it seems to melt and sink into my skin quickly. The sugar scrub is also amazing for leaving my skin smooth and soft. While I like the body lotion, it's a more subtle scent than the lotion and scrub.\nI hope that they eventually sell a vanilla or a lavender range as their 3 current scents are quite uplifting and I love using something relaxing at night.\nDid you purchase anything in the Boxing Day sales?\nAwesome Boxing Day haul! I didn't buy anything in the sales - trying to cut back!! I have the same brush tree and I love it!! I love my E25 minis but now I want to try the E45!\nThe brush tree is wonderful. It makes washing my brushes so much easier and less hectic.\nI haven't touched the sales since I'm waiting on Priceline's 40% off skincare sale sometime this month.\nI'm lusting after that same Benjabelle brush tree you bought! I own that same Sigma tapered blending brush (albeit with the silver ferrule & writing, not the copper) & if I'm honest, I don't like it. Whilst it feels soft at first, after you wash it it becomes scratchy...or at least that's what's happened to me. Not sure what I can do to get it soft again...maybe use some conditioner?\nThe brush tree is fantastic. I'd recommend it!! It makes cleaning your brushes a lot easier and less messy.\nOhh that's no good! What do you wash your brushes with?\nI can't remember what I washed that one with at first, but normally I use a mild shampoo (Moogoo's one) to wash my brushes. I might've used that, but I'm not sure why it made the brush scratchy, unless I was using the wrong product for the type of brush that it is (I think it's synthetic hairs?).\nBrush trees are so great, aren't they? I wouldn't mind trying that scrub.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T16:20:30Z", "url": "http://www.bottledbeauty.com/2016/01/boxing-day-collective-haul-featuring.html", "byte_size": 4837, "char_size": 4837}

{"text": "If we are to manage for any wildlife species it is imperative that the necessary habitat requirements for their survival be provided. An example is the Kirtland\u2019s Warbler, an avian specie that was on the brink of extinction. They require a certain age class of jackpine, in a specific density, with an acreage requirement per bird.\nKey Wild Turkey habitat ingredients as specified by the DNR are trees, shrubs and grass in close proximity to each other.\nGrassy openings supply an abundance of insects, seeds and other foods for adults and especially for poults.\nWhen the turkey fund was established there was a commitment to the turkey hunters that if they would buy a special license it would be used to manage Wild Turkeys throughout the state. If Wild Turkeys are to be managed as the law requires then the DNR is required to establish and manage the critical key habitat requirements of the Wild Turkey throughout the entire state.\nAs far back as over a quarter century ago we discovered the huge blocks of mast producing hardwoods on our state forests were absent of Wild Turkeys. One of the key habitat ingredients of managed, grassy wildlife openings were non existent. As we inquired from field biologists why wildlife openings were not being created a common answer was given that there was no money. No money? That is exactly what the turkey fund was established for. So where was and is the money going? This began several decades of being stone walled in an attempt to find out.\nFinally in 2005 we were able to get a peek at the 2002 turkey fund expenditures as the Natural Resources Commission was reviewing all of the restricted funds, then the door closed again. Since the establishment of the turkey fund in 1977 millions of dollars have been spent on 400,000 acres of state game areas in southern Michigan and virtually nothing has gone to the 3.9 million acres of state forests.\nDuring the 2002 period $2,533,071 was spent. Expenditures went for parking lots and gates, herbaceous planting, opening maintenance. $429,981 was spent on stream bank stabilization on private property and $872,144 spent on turkey habitat acquisition, all in southern Michigan. We monitor all of the Natural Resources Commission meetings and never was the Turkey Fund listed as providing funds for land purchases.\nThe Turkey Fund did indeed fund these land purchases but under another name. It took some time to get the criteria of these purchases and not one mentioned Wild Turkey. River, stream and lake frontage was included as the purchase of 15 acres including a 2 story house, 3 car garage and barn for $250,000, which later had to be torn down probably using the Turkey Fund. Obviously, under the guise of turkey management the DNR has used our license dollars as a slush fund with virtually nothing being returned to our state forests.\nOn advising private landowners how to manage their land for Wild Turkey the DNR advises that 5 percent should be in managed grassy openings. This should be true for our hardwood state forest lands. In partnership with the Michigan Conservation Foundation the MWTHA examined a comparison of managed grassy openings in various state forest management units inventories for treatment in 2006. It doesn\u2019t make much difference if it is 2006, 1996 or 2010 it is the same situation.\nIt must be remembered that forest openings are critical habitat for a great number of wildlife species, from deer to insects. So is DNR management providing these? As an example of the forest compartment inventories, Pigeon River Country 12,114 acres with 20 openings totaling 121 acres, Gladwin 20,218 acres with 2 managed openings totaling 19 acres, Cadillac 24,336 acres with 2 managed openings toting 24 acres, Roscommon 24,001 acres with 10 managed openings totaling 119 acres, etc.\nFor the first time the DNR Wildlife Division submitted to the public the Turkey Fund expenditures for 2010. A total of $1,693,000 is appropriated. $1,453,045 is allocated to 400,000 acres of state game areas, while $239,955 is allocated to 3.9 million acres of state forests through out northern Michigan. Very little is actually going to reach the ground of our state forests.\nSeveral years ago the U.S. Forest Service contracted with Michigan State University to conduct a study of the recreational use of the Huron-Manistee National Forest. The number one use was found to be hunting. During their planning of the 2006 Huron-Manistee plan the USFS stated that 35 percent of licensed hunters in Michigan hunted on national forest lands. Michigan State University acknowledged the same is true for out state forests. It would seem logical that the DNR would be obligated to manage these 3.9 million acres for game birds and animals, however this is not the case.\nMinimum habitat is not being provided and deer, grouse, woodcock, rabbit, hare and turkey. Their numbers are suppressed on our state forests. As recently as 1992 Michigan had 1,171,721 hunters. In 2008 there were 790,789. We have lost 380,932 hunters during that time. We have lost a third of our hunters during that time period.\nSouthern Michigan is one huge tract of Wild Turkey habitat with its agriculture and wood lots, controlled by private land owners. Development and sprawl is eating wildlife habitat. Unless one can afford to lease hunting land or has a relative who does, access is very difficult. The future of hunting in Michigan is dependent on our public forests. The lack of game on our state forests is reflected in the alarming loss of our hunters.\nOver the years we have met with a series of DNR Wildlife Division chiefs, staff, with DNR Directors and have testified many times before the Natural Resources Commission only to fall on deaf ears. It appears that the only recourse we have is to seek legislation that will mandate the distribution and use of the fund.

I found that the largest size of fishnets worked the best (it was a pretty big pumpkin) (photo3).\nHow AWESOME does it look in photo4?! I added a bow to fill the gap between the flowers and the pumpkin. Gorgeous right?\nEasy to do yourself! I used a taller cylinder vase. As long as the vase can fit inside of a pumpkin, you're good! You can use traditional Halloween colours for your flowers if you like (photo5).\nA little tutorial on a \"DIY\" Floral Pumpkin Arrangement. Flora International is here to deliver! This time we decided to start you off on a much smaller scale. Get your baby pumpkins ready!\nMaterials: Small pumpkin, 4inch square piece of cellophane wrapping paper(or similar), a block of floral foam(you must soak in water beforehand), a few stems of greenery(the smaller the better) and a few flowers.\nREMEMBER. Giving all your flowers and greens a clean cut with a sharp knife or scissors is best. Always on an angle! This enables everything to drink the water and hydrate properly. The angle helps with placing through the floral foam as well.\nStep 1: Carve out your mini pumpkin.\nStep 2: Stuff the cellophane into the carved pumpkin to create a lining. If you do not do this the pumpkin will rot when in contact with water.\nStep 4: Cut the excess cellophane off around the edge of the pumpkin opening.\nStep 5: Slice off the top of the floral foam. Only leave about an inch or half inch sticking out of the pumpkin opening. See photo8 for the end result. I cut little angles into the foam so it's easier to stick your greens and flower stems into the foam.\nStep 6: Cut mini pieces of greenery to make the base shape of your arrangement. Place them all around in a circular motion and conitnue the same placement method as you move towards the center of the foam as you see in photo9. We used \"Leather Leaf Fern\"\nStep 7: You are now ready to stick your flowers in! A \"triangular design\" is usually the easiest and simplest way too arrange the flowers. In this case, for example; we used a rose, a decorative cabbage and folded leaves to complete the tightly knit trio. You can also use the top of the pumpkin! Unless you threw it away already... haha! Just poke the underside of the pumpkin- top with a stick(leftover stem of flower) and add it to the arrangement.\nNow enjoy your beautiful floral pumpkin and show it off! Makes a cute Halloween decoration or a fun gift idea!\nHope you enjoyed the decorating ideas and tips.\nWe will be handing out candy in our shop at the Pointe Claire Plaza Halloween Event. See you there!", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T10:48:55Z", "url": "http://www.florainternationalflowers.com/fra/blog/showing-you-our-halloween-spirit", "byte_size": 3204, "char_size": 3203}

{"text": "The City collects garbage weekly from 600,000 households along 350 daily routes. The City has long organized garbage collection services on a ward-by-ward basis. The City assigns the laborers and motor truck drivers who collect garbage in individual wards, where they work on truck routes that do not cross ward boundaries.\nHowever, the City\u2019s recycling pickup is organized based on a regional routing system that does not take into account ward boundaries.\nUnder this option, the City would shift its garbage collection to a regional, grid-based system. By comparing the efficiency of recycling collection with garbage collection, we can estimate what efficiencies might be achieved through a regional, grid-based system of garbage collection.\nAccording to the City\u2019s Mobile Asset Tracking system (CMAT), the City currently has 43 recycling trucks. Assuming that these trucks are all continually operational, the City is providing recycling services to 241,000 households every other week using 43 daily routes.36 The table below compares the difference in annual pickups per daily route of garbage collection and recycling.\nThe table shows that recycling collection, which uses regional routing, averages significantly more pickups per route than garbage collection, which uses the ward system.\nThis is despite the fact that recycling trucks only have one laborer assigned, while some garbage trucks have two. However, garbage collection averages nearly 11 tons collected per daily route per day, while recycling collection averages only 4.65 tons per daily route per day.\nBecause garbage collection is collecting significantly more tonnage per route, workers spend less time collecting because the trucks must make more frequent trips to dump their loads.\nIn 2008, the average load dumped at City-owned dumpsites was 6.65 tons. Based on the average tons collected per route per day, garbage collection averages 1.65 loads per day and recycling averages 0.7 loads per day.\nFor simplicity, assume that garbage collection dumps two loads per day and recycling dumps one load per day, and one load in each program is dumped after the 8-hour collection shift is over through the City\u2019s night shuttle program.\nUnder these assumptions, garbage collection is interrupted by one dump during the 8-hour collection shift, while recycling collection is not. Assuming an average dump takes 1.5 hours, garbage is collected an average of 6.5 hours per route per day, while recycling is collected for the full 8-hour collection shift.\nThe table below compares the estimated pickups per hour for garbage and recycling collection and shows that recycling collection using regional routing is more efficient in terms of pickups per hour than garbage collection based on the ward system.\nIf garbage collection averaged the same number of pickups per hour as recycling collection, the number of daily routes could be reduced to 264, or a 24.6% reduction.\nAssuming that a 24.6% reduction in routes would yield a 24.6% reduction in staffing devoted to garbage collection, the table below details the reduction in personnel and associated personnel costs that would be realized.\nThe table shows that if the City were to move to a grid-based routing system for garbage collection and achieve the same efficiency that the regional routing of recycling is currently achieving, the City might reduce its 2010 personnel costs by up to $24.1 million through the elimination of up to 297 positions.\nBecause of contractual increases in personnel costs, the savings from implementing this option would grow in future years.\nThe 2011 and 2012 salaries of Laborers and Motor Truck Drivers will be higher due to collective bargaining agreements, which call for salary increases of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012.\nAssuming that there are no increases in salaries for the other positions and that the furloughs are continued in their current form, the table below shows the increase in compensation costs over the next two years for the 297 eliminated positions.\nIn addition to the savings from a reduction in the number of daily routes, additional savings could be generated by reducing the number of laborers on the remaining routes to one laborer per truck.\nWith 264 daily routes, operating approximately 250 days a year, there are approximately 66,000 annual routes. Assuming that the average sanitation worker works 200 days per year (after holidays, vacation days, and sick and disability leave) to ensure that there would be a sufficient reserve to avoid un-staffed routes, 330 sanitation laborers would be needed to fully staff the 66,000 routes.\nThis would mean an additional reduction in the number of laborers by 122. At an average compensation of $75,579, their total compensation in 2010 would equal $9.2 million.\nThe 2011 and 2012 compensation will be higher due to the Laborers collective bargaining agreement, which calls for a salary increase of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012. Assuming that the furloughs remain in place, the compensation for these 122 positions will cost $9.5 million in 2011 and $9.8 million in 2012.\nThese savings will be slightly reduced because under the current collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers Union, sanitation laborers working on one-laborer garbage trucks are to be paid 9 percent more than their regular hourly rate.\nThus, the reduction in 122 laborers would on average result in 122 additional laborers working on a one-laborer garbage truck, resulting in a 9 percent increase in their salaries. This would cost an additional $856,000 in 2011 and $885,000 in 2012.\nAdditionally, under the agreement between the City and Coalition of Union Public Employees (COUPE) to impose furlough days from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011, if the City chooses to lay off employees during this period, all laid off employees will be paid for any unpaid holidays or furlough days taken since July 1, 2009.\nThus, if the City were to lay off the 269 total sanitation laborers and 110 motor truck drivers, the affected employees would have to be paid approximately 13.5 percent of their salaries to compensate for unpaid days they have taken over the last year and a half, since the furlough agreement has been in place. This would reduce the savings in 2011 by an additional $3.8 million.\nTherefore, the total estimated savings from switching to regional routing system of garbage collection and reducing the number of laborers on the remaining routes to 1 would be $29.6 million in 2011 and $34.5 million in 2012.\nOf course, there would be additional savings from reducing the City\u2019s fleet of garbage trucks such as savings in future truck purchases, maintenance costs, gas, oil, etc.\nProponents might argue that organizing garbage collection on a ward-by-ward basis is inefficient and wasteful. They would argue that organizing collection by regional grid would reduce the time it takes for workers to get from the ward yard to the routes and routes could be organized to reduce the distance from route to dumpsite.\nThey may also cite an IGO investigation in 2008 that found that garbage collection crews worked, on average, only 75 percent of the work day, indicating that there was not enough work for the collection crews to perform. Additionally, they might cite the fact that Streets and Sanitation decided to organize recycling collection on a regional, grid-based system in order to deliver the service more cheaply.\nOpponents might argue that ward-based system provides better customer service than a more centralized grid system.\nWith ward-by-ward service, City residents have a more direct relationship with the City workers who coordinate garbage collection in their neighborhoods. Some might also argue that garbage collection has long been a primary responsibility of the City\u2019s aldermen and that this has resulted in cleaner streets, timelier pickups, and satisfied residents.\nReduce the Number of Laborers on a Garbage Truck to 1 Savings: $10.3 million in 2011, $12 million in 2012.\nOn some of the City\u2019s garbage trucks, the City assigns two laborers and one motor truck driver.... These employees are responsible for the weekly collection of garbage from 600,000 households along 350 daily routes.\nUntil the last couple of years, the City generally assigned two laborers to each garbage truck. However, due to budget cuts, the City has reduced the number of budgeted sanitation laborers from 816 in 2008 to 599 in 2010. This reduction in laborers means that a significant portion of the 350 daily routes are manned by one laborer.\nUnder this option, the City would further reduce the number of laborers devoted to garbage collection, so that on average one laborer is assigned to each garbage truck.\nWith 350 daily routes, operating approximately 250 days a year, there are approximately 87,500 annual routes. Assuming that the average sanitation worker works 200 days per year (after holidays, vacation days, and sick and disability leave) to ensure that there would be a sufficient reserve to avoid un-staffed routes, 438 sanitation laborers would be needed to fully staff the 87,500 routes.\nThis means that the number of laborers could be reduced by approximately 161.50 At an average compensation of $75,579 their total compensation in 2010 would equal $12.2 million. The 2011 and 2012 compensation will be higher due to the Laborers collective bargaining agreement, which calls for a salary increase of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012. Assuming that the furloughs remain in place, the compensation for these 161 positions will cost $12.6 million in 2011 and $13 million in 2012.\nThese savings will be reduced because under the current collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers Union, sanitation laborers working on one-laborer garbage trucks are to be paid 9 percent more than their regular hourly rate.\nThus, the reduction in 161 laborers would on average result in 161 additional laborers working on a one-laborer garbage truck, resulting in a 9 percent increase in their salaries. This would cost an additional $934,000 in 2011 and $967,000 in 2012.\nFinally, under the agreement between the City and Coalition of Union Public Employees (COUPE) to impose furlough days from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011, if the City chooses to lay off employees during this period, all laid off employees will be paid for any unpaid holidays or furlough days taken since July 1, 2009.\nThus, if the City were to lay off 161 laborers, the affected laborers would have to be paid approximately 13.5 percent of their salaries to compensate for unpaid days they have taken over the last year and a half, since the furlough agreement has been in place. This would reduce the savings in 2011 by an additional $1.36 million.\nAfter subtracting the reduced savings due to the increased pay for 1-person garbage trucks and the furlough payback provision, the savings from implementing this option would be approximately $10.3 million in 2011 and $12 million in 2012.\nProponents might argue that the City no longer needs two laborers on a garbage truck because the trucks are now semi-automated, meaning garbage carts are lifted and dumped by a mechanism on the back of the trucks.\nThey may also cite an IGO investigation in 2008 that found that garbage collection crews worked, on average, only 75 percent of the work day, indicating that there was not enough work for the collection crews to perform.\nOthers might argue that few cities have three staff assigned to each garbage truck. According to 2008 data from the International City/County Management Association\u2019s (ICMA), among the six jurisdictions with over 500,000 people which submitted data only one (San Antonio) had 3 staff per garbage vehicle, and this is likely because collection is done manually.\nThe other five jurisdictions (Phoenix, Miami-Dade County, Dallas, Austin, and Oklahoma City) all had 1 person per vehicle and automated or semi-automated collection.\nOpponents might argue that reducing the number of laborers to one on all garbage trucks would reduce the quality of collection service in the City. They would argue that reducing the number of laborers could result in less frequent service as it takes trucks longer to perform their routes.\nAdditionally, others might argue that in addition to their collection responsibilities, laborers sweep alleys, pick up trash, or remove street-sweeping signs. Reducing the number of laborers would mean a reduction in these services.\nSimple. Organize the wards on a grid system, rather than gerrymandered as they are now. Makes the garbage collection more efficient, while keeping it in the hands of the aldermen.\nThe trucks on the Far North Side are picking up less garbage than a year ago.\nI know this because while they're leaving the garage on Ravenswood Ave. at the same time every morning, they're coming back for the day way before they used to. Now they return as early as 2 PM, while a year ago it was at 3 PM. All the workers cars are gone by 3 PM now, it used to take until 4 PM last year.\nThe only explanation for the ward by ward system appears to be the very least paragraph which to me seems pretty flimsy. How are the residents' or aldermen's relationships with the city workers stronger if they don't cross ward boundaries on any given day? They still have to pick up their garbage every week? I don't get that at all.\n---I also found it interesting that the city apparently picks up about twice the tonnage of trash than it does recycling. In the superboonies where I live, the ratio is more than twice the opposite. We have two wheeled containers for each house; one for recycling, and a somewhat larger one for trash. We fill the recycling container each week, and the trash container has a few things in the bottom of it; some garbage, contaminated paper not suitable for recycling, used facial tissues, the occasional diaper when the grandchildren come visiting. The city's ratio is possibly a residuum of the blue bag program; people just aren't used to a serious recycling program yet.\nAnd oh yes: the collection trucks have a claw on the side that picks up the container, upends it and dumps it. One man per truck, and he never has to get out.\nCut down on high absenteeism while you're at it.\nI lived in Chicago until 1975 and knew that if you wanted to guarantee that the old loveseat or refrigerator that you hauled out to your alley were to be picked up it was a good idea to meet the garbage truck with maybe a cold six pack in a brown bag or possibly a $5 bill discreetly passed to the driver. Actually, you could give it to any one of the three or four 'workers' who either drove, rode on the back of, or walked along behind, the truck. Since then I've lived in the suburbs (Alsip, Justice, Worth, Lockport) and have enjoyed simple, cost effective trash collection by various private refuse companies. I have never, in more than 35 years, had to call to complain about the service I've received. This includes picking up couchs, freezers, construction waste or trees. If there's a holiday, flood, blizzard or any other form of delay they're there the day after the normal pick-up day, never later. The most amazing part is, all of this is done by one worker, and has been for the last 20 years. So, until somebody in city government grows a pair and finally decides to attack the real problem, this totally wasteful practice will continue.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T23:52:40Z", "url": "https://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2011/08/getting-on-the-grid.html", "byte_size": 15427, "char_size": 15413}

{"text": "What Does Peter Mean By Jesus Preaching to the Spirits in Prison?\nThis is among the most difficult verses in the New Testament to understand and preach. The following is shared primarily for the sake of other pastors researching this fascinating verse and wrestling with the challenge of understanding how v.19 fits into the verses before and after.\nThere is a different between teaching and preaching. A sermon must involve teaching the text without getting bogged down by exegetical details. Expository sermons must lead to the heart, not only to the mind. Therefore, passages like 1 Peter 3:19 should not be avoided (lest we unintentionally teach the congregation to be scared of hard Bible passages), but we must not allow them to completely derail the sermon.\n1. When Jesus died his spirit went to the souls of men and women who died in the generation of Noah (referred to in v.20) and preached to them. Other variants of this view allow that he more generally preached to the souls of the dead and not only to Noah\u2019s generation.\n2. Jesus preached to those who were \u201cspiritually imprisoned\u201d through Noah. The difference between this view and the first has to do with time. In the first view, Jesus preached to the souls of those who died. In this view, Jesus preached to them prior to the flood. The two schools of thought here can either mean that the Holy Spirit preached through Noah, or the pre-incarnate Christ preached to that generation in some way.\n3. The spirits in prison are not spirits but angels. These may be demonic spirits since they are in prison or angels of the \u201cguardian angel\u201d variety who oversee humanity. It is not immediately obvious exactly who these spirits are, or what Jesus preached to them.\nExegesis is the process of digging into the biblical text and drawing the meaning out of the text, rather than coming to the text and reading your preferred interpretation into the passage.\nThere are three crucial exegetical details in this one short verse that provide great insight into the meaning of the verse. We\u2019ll look at them in order of how they appear in v.19.\n1. \u201cPreached\u201d not \u201cEvangelized.\u201d There are different Greek words for \u201cpreach\u201d and \u201cpreach the gospel.\u201d The first word is what is used in 1 Peter 3:19. If Jesus was preaching the gospel and providing these spirits an opportunity to believe and repent and be saved, Peter would have used evangelize (as he did in many other places throughout 1 Peter and 2 Peter). Therefore, it seems most reasonable to conclude that the content of this preaching was not an invitation to be saved, but some form of instruction or announcement.\n2. \u201cSpirit\u201d does not mean \u201csoul.\u201d There is no place in the New Testament where the word \u201cspirit\u201d refers to a human soul. I did not personally double check ever single instance throughout the NT, but I\u2019m relying on the many commentaries which point this detail out. If spirit does not mean human soul, then it must refer to either angelic or demonic spirits.\nI prefer not to mix too much interpretation into the translation, so allow me to flesh this out below.\nThere remain outstanding questions, primarily regarding the disobedience mentioned in v.20. I wish I had time to study the accuracy placing a period at the end of v.19, thus rendering the \u201cBecause they formerly did not obey\u201d as the grounds for Noah\u2019s generation being judged through the flood rather than serving as the grounds for the spirits being imprisoned. This exegetical issue aside, I continue to believe the interpretation below is the most reasonable I have been able to discern.\nThe angels in watch are those who have been commissioned by God to watch over humanity. This is widely accepted throughout church history, that there are certain classes of angels who guard and protect humanity.\nJesus preached and declared to them that a new hour of their watch had arrived, where the waters would no longer be a means of judgment (as in the days of Noah, v.20) but of salvation through baptism (v.21). It is a new chapter in Salvation History. The Old Covenant has been fulfilled through the New Covenant, bringing salvation through faith alone in Christ alone. The nations are no longer under condemnation, but salvation is offered to all who believe.\nIn 1 Peter 3:21, Peter clarifies that baptism is \u201can appeal\u201d (ESV) or \u201ca pledge\u201d (NIV) for a good conscience. Baptism is not salvific, nor does it bring salvation the same way water washes away dirt. Instead, it is symbolic of the saving grace of Jesus Christ and reminds the believer of his living hope because of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nThrough this interpretation of v.19, there is greater continuity throughout the chapter than with any of the other interpretations. I must confess that while many scholars affirm the \u201cspirits are angels\u201d view, I could not find any who clearly articulated it in this same way. The closest is John Calvin who writes in his commentaries, \u201cIt seems to me that \u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u1f74 rather means a watchtower in which watchmen stand for the purpose of watching, or the very act of watching.\u201d He simply states this without clarifying why he prefers this translation and does not fully explain the significance of translating the passage in this way.\nWith that said, I humbly submit the above interpretation and trust that it may help others who are looking to understand 1 Peter 3:19.\nI have often said, \u201cIf you ever preach an original sermon, you\u2019re probably a heretic.\u201d I think the same stands for biblical interpretation. So it is with self-doubt that I offer this interpretation, though it does appear that I\u2019m standing with John Calvin and simply clarifying something he wrote which has gone largely unacknowledged.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T00:49:26Z", "url": "https://livingtheologically.com/2015/11/02/what-does-peter-mean-by-jesus-preaching-to-the-spirits-in-prison/", "byte_size": 5782, "char_size": 5703}
{"text": "* I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s telling the truth here (although I have my suspicions), but it looks like the governor\u2019s people are more than hinting that Comptroller Hynes is trying to force a budget crisis. On the other hand, it might be assumed that the governor\u2019s office is keeping the squeeze on Medicaid providers in order to prod them into backing his GRT plan, which would provide lots of cashola.\nThe Blagojevich administration missed a chance to pay $650 million in Medicaid bills in early April, despite a suggestion to act from Comptroller Dan Hynes\u2019 office, the agency said Tuesday.\nKnowles said the payment plan relied on money borrowed short term to kick-start an assessment program that taxes hospitals to obtain additional federal money to treat Medicaid patients. However, the legislature still hasn\u2019t approved a supplemental spending bill needed to fully implement the hospital assessment program.\nThe man behind the so-called tax-swap proposal to fund Illinois schools said Tuesday night that McHenry County state legislators were acting neither fairly nor morally in rejecting his measure.\nYou were on that bus with him. Does he seem capable of pulling these stunts?\nBlagojevich likes to fight and bully, while Hynes is as vanilla as me but comes off as meek. Blagojevich will tell you anything, while Hynes seems very straight-forward.\nI\u2019d rather believe Hynes over Blagojevich. But then again, Blagojevich has proved repeatedly that no one should believe anything he says.\nBottom line - tough noogies. The Democrats renominated Blagojevich knowing fully well his numerous shortcomings and scandals. When Blagojevich is done playing with Illinois, the Illinois Democratic Party should be held accountable for the damage done.\nMartire\u2019s board includes AFSCME, IFT and AFL-CIO reps. That says more than any speech Ralph gives about where he\u2019s coming from. At least the GRT would provide some health insurance. Ralph wants to give most of our money to the schools regardless of actual education bureaucracy performance, plus some tasty bites of the money pie to unionized state government.\nIt\u2019s all bait and switch. Bait us with a little property tax relief into a permanent income tax increase without mentioning that the property tax relief won\u2019t be much and won\u2019t last long.\nIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that Hynes would try to get some press at Blagojevich\u2019s expense. He did it many times in the first term. This is just another example of Hynes using the governor to get himself some positive press.\nIsnt it time to combine the offices of comptroller and treasurer anyway? Why do we have these unnecessary constitutional offices? We could probably do away with the Lt. Governor for that matter. What real purpose does the Lt. Gov serve?\nHynes seems to relativity honest and straight talking, unlike Governor Blagojevich, so I would believe Hynes over Blagojevich. Particular when you take some of the latter\u2019s political stunts into account and the history of not paying Medicaid bills.\nUsually the HFS folks are the ones who are disingenuous about Medicaid payments, but in this case, HFS probably had little choice but to conserve appropriations for the balance of the fiscal year in order to be able to pay their hardship providers. The Comptroller was correct in saying that there was a period of enhanced liquidity due to the proceeds from the hospital assessment. However, HFS simply didn\u2019t have the appropriation reserves necessary to utilize it.\nI think the Comptroller was trying to call out the Governor on the Medicaid deficit, knowing that at this point in the fiscal year, HFS couldn\u2019t respond.\nFor the love of God. Pay these people already! They have waited long enough. What are you waiting for? A good day for a press release to announce that you are graciously repaying a debt that you owe.\nStart by paying the people who have been waiting the longest and start now.

{"text": "10mg/ml: Each ml of oral solution contains 10mg furosemide.\nEach ml of solution contains 0.2ml liquid maltitol (E965) and 83.2mg ethanol (alcohol).\nClear, colourless, greenish yellow to pale brown coloured solution with cherry flavour.\nFurosemide is indicated in all conditions requiring prompt diuresis in patients who are unable to take solid dose forms. Indications include cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic and renal oedema, peripheral oedema due to mechanical obstruction or venous insufficiency and hypertension.\nThe medication should be administered in the morning to avoid nocturnal diuresis.\nThe usual initial daily dose is 40mg. This may be adjusted until an effective dose is achieved.\nIn the elderly, furosemide is generally eliminated more slowly. Dosage should be titrated until the required response is achieved.\nThis product should not be used in children below 18 years of age (see section 4.4).\nThis product should not be mixed with food or beverages before use.\nThe syringe adaptor should be placed in the neck of the bottle and the required dose should be drawn from the container into the graduated oral syringe provided. The open end of the syringe should be placed in the mouth of the patient, and the piston slowly depressed to release the contents.\nHypovolaemia or dehydration. Anuria. Renal failure with anuria not responding to furosemide, or as a result of poisoning by nephrotoxic or hepatotoxic agents, or associated with hepatic coma. Severe hypokalaemia and severe hyponatraemia. Pre-comatose and comatose states associated with hepatic encephalopathy. Breast feeding.\nContra-indicated in hypersensitivity to Furosemide, sulphonamides or any of the excipients listed.\nPatients allergic to sulphonamides may show cross-sensitivity to furosemide.\nThis product should not be given to children because its ethanol content may affect their CNS.\nCaution is required in patients liable to electrolyte deficiency. Regular monitoring of serum sodium, potassium and creatinine is generally recommended during furosemide therapy; particularly close monitoring is required in patients at high risk of developing electrolyte imbalances or in case of significant additional fluid loss. Hypovolaemia or dehydration as well as any significant electrolyte and acid-base disturbances must be corrected. This may require temporary discontinuation of furosemide. Where indicated, steps should be taken to correct hypotension or hypovolaemia before commencing therapy.\nUrinary output must be secured. Patients with partial obstructions of urinary outflow for example patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition have an increased risk of developing acute urinary retention and require careful monitoring.\n\u2022 Patients with hypoproteinaemia, e.g. associated with nephrotic syndrome (the effect of furosemide may be weakened and its ototoxicity potentiated).\nSymptomatic hypotension leading to dizziness, fainting or loss of consciousness can occur in patients treated with furosemide, particularly in the elderly, patients on other medications which can cause hypotension and patients with other medical conditions that are risks for hypotension.\nThe use of some diuretics is considered to be unsafe in acute porphyria therefore caution should be exercised.\nConcomitant use with risperidone: In risperidone placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia, a higher incidence of mortality was observed in patients treated with furosemide plus risperidone (7.3%; mean age 89 years, range 75-97 years) when compared to patients treated with risperidone alone (3.1%; mean age 84 years, range 70-96 years) or furosemide alone (4.1%; mean age 80 years, range 67-90 years). Concomitant use of risperidone with other diuretics (mainly thiazide diuretics used in low dose) was not associated with similar findings.\nNo pathophysiological mechanism has been identified to explain this finding, and no consistent pattern for cause of death observed. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised and the risks and benefits of this combination or co-treatment with other potent diuretics should be considered prior to the decision to use. There was no increased incidence of mortality among patients taking other diuretics as concomitant treatment with risperidone. Irrespective of treatment, dehydration was an overall risk factor for mortality and should therefore be avoided in elderly patients with dementia (see section 4.3).\nFurosemide is not recommended in patients at high risk for radiocontrast nephropathy - it should not be used for diuresis as part of the preventative measures against radiocontrast-induced nephropathy.\nEthanol (alcohol): Each ml of oral solution contains 83.2mg ethanol (alcohol) i.e daily dose of 40mg furosemide would include 332.8mg ethanol (alcohol), equivalent to 8.32ml of beer or 3.47ml of wine.\nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism. To be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women and high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease, epilepsy. Because of its ethanol content this product should also not be given to children.\nLiquid maltitol (E965): Patients with a rare hereditary problem of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine.\nACE Inhibitors: Enhanced hypotensive effect when given with diuretics. A marked fall in blood pressure and deterioration in renal function may be seen when ACE inhibitors are added to furosemide therapy. The dose of furosemide should be reduced for at least three days, or the drug stopped, before initiating the ACE inhibitor or increasing the dose of an ACE inhibitor.\nAlpha-blockers: Enhanced hypotensive effect when diuretics are given with alpha-blockers, also increased risk of first dose hypotension with post-synaptic alpha-blockers such as prazosin.\nAnalgesics: Diuretics can increase the risk of nephrotoxicity of NSAIDs, also antagonism of diuretic effect. Antagonism of diuretic effect (especially with indomethacin and ketorolac). Salicylic toxicity may be increased by furosemide.\nAngiotensin \u2013II Receptor Antagonists: Enhanced hypotensive effect when diuretics given with angiotensin-II receptor antagonists.\nAnti-arrhythmics: Hypokalaemia caused by loop diuretics increases cardiac toxicity with amiodarone, disopyramide, flecainide, and antagonises the action of lidocaine and mexiletine.\nAntibacterials: Avoid the use of diuretics in lymecycline treatment. There is an increased risk of ototoxicity when loop diuretics are given with aminoglycosides, polymyxins or vancomycin. Since this may lead to irreversible damage, these drugs must only be used with furosemide if there are compelling medical reasons. Impairment of renal function may develop in patients receiving concurrent treatment with furosemide and high doses of certain cephalosporins.\nAntidepressants: Possible increase of hypokalaemia when loop diuretics are given with reboxetine. There is an enhanced hypotensive effect when diuretics are given with MAOIs. There is an increased risk of postural hypotension when diuretics are given with tricyclic antidepressants.\nAntiepileptics: There is an increased risk of hyponatraemia when diuretics are given with carbemazepine. The effects of furosemide are antagonised by phenytoin.\nAntifungals: There is an increased risk of hypokalaemia when loop diuretics are given with amphotericin.\nAntipsychotics: Hypokalaemia caused by diuretics increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias with amisulpiride or sertindole. An enhanced hypotensive effect may be seen when diuretics are given with phenothiazines. Hypokalaemia caused by diuretics increases risk of ventricular arrhythmias with pimozide (avoid concomitant use).\nAntivirals: Plasma concentration of diuretics may be increased by nelfinavir, ritonavir or saquinavir.\nAtomoxetine: Hypokalaemia caused by diuretics increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias with atomoxetine.\nBarbiturates: Plasma concentrations of diuretics may be decreased. There may be an increased risk of osteomalacia when diuretics are taken in combination with Phenobarbital.\nBeta-blockers: There is an enhanced hypotensive effect when diuretics are given with beta-blockers. Hypokalaemia caused by loop diuretics increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias with sotalol.\nCardiac glycosides: Hypokalaemia caused by loop diuretics increases cardiac toxicity with cardiac glycosides.\nCiclosporin: there is an increased risk of nephrotoxicity and possibly hypermagnesaemia when diuretics are given with ciclosporin.\nCisplatin: There is a risk of increased ototoxic effects if cisplatin and furosemide are given concomitantly. In addition, nephrotoxicity of cisplatin may be enhanced if furosemide is not given in low doses (e.g. 40mg in patients with normal renal function) and with positive fluid balance when used to achieve forced diuresis during cisplatin treatment.\nCorticosteroids: The diuretic effect of diuretics is antagonized by corticosteroids. There is an increased risk of hypokalaemia when loop diuretics are given with corticosteroids.\nOther Diuretics: There is an increased risk of hypokalaemia when loop diuretics are given with acetazolamide. Profound diuresis is possible when metolazone is given with furosemide. There is an increased risk of hypokalaemia when loop diuretics are given with thiazides and related diuretics.\nLithium: Loop diuretics reduce the excretion of lithium, which may lead to increased plasma concentrations and a risk of toxicity. Therefore, it is recommended that lithium levels are carefully monitored and where necessary the lithium dosage is adjusted in patients receiving this combination.\nPotassium salts: There is an increased risk of hyperkalaemia when given with potassium salts.\nSucralfate: Furosemide and sucralfate must not be taken within 2 hours of each other as sucralfate decreases the absorption of furosemide from the intestine and so reduces its effect.\nSympathomimetics, Beta2: There is an increased risk of hypokalameia when loop diuretics are given with high doses of beta2 synpathomimetics.\nTacrolimus: There is an increased risk of hypokalaemia when given with tacrolimus.\nTheophylline: There is an increased risk of hypokalaemia when loop diuretics are given with theophylline.\nCarbenoxolone, prolonged use of laxatives, liquorice: May increase the risk of developing hypokalaemia.\nWarfarin and clofibrate: Warfarin and clofibrate compete with furosemide in the binding to serum albumin. This may have clinical significance in patients with low serum albumin levels (e.g. in nephrotic syndrome). Furosemide does not change the pharmacokinetics of warfarin to a significant extent, but a strong diuresis with associated dehydration may weaken the antithrombotic effect of warfarin.\nProbenecid, methotrexate and other drugs which, like furosemide, undergo significant renal tubular secretion may reduce the effect of furosemide. Conversely, furosemide may decrease renal elimination of these drugs. In case of high-dose treatment (in particular, of both furosemide and the other drugs), this may lead to increased serum levels and an increased risk of adverse effects due to furosemide or the concomitant medication.\nRisperidone: When administering risperidone, caution should be exercised and the risks and benefits of the combination or co-treatment with furosemide or with other potent diuretics should be considered prior to the decision to use. See section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use regarding increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia concomitantly receiving risperidone.\nResults of animal work, in general, show no hazardous effect of furosemide in pregnancy. There is clinical evidence of safety of the drug in the third trimester of human pregnancy; however, furosemide crosses the placental barrier. It must not be given during pregnancy unless there are compelling medical reasons. Treatment during pregnancy requires monitoring of fetal growth.\nFurosemide passes into breast milk and may inhibit lactation. Breastfeeding must be avoided during treatment with furosemide.\nNo human data on the effect of furosemide on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on mating or fertility with furosemide treatment.\nMental alertness may be reduced and the ability to drive or operate machinery may be impaired.\nIn general, if furosemide is administered to premature infants during the first weeks of life, it may increase the risk of persistence of patent ductus arteriosus. Risk of nephrocalcinosis/ nephroliathisis.\nThe clinical picture in acute or chronic overdose depends primarily on the extent and consequences of electrolyte and fluid loss, e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, haemoconcentration, cardiac arrhythmias \u2013 including A-V block and ventricular fibrillation. Symptoms of these disturbances include severe hypotension (progressing to shock), acute renal failure, thrombosis, delirious states, flaccid paralysis, apathy and confusion.\nThere are no specific antidotes to furosemide. If the ingestion is recent, attempts to limit further systemic absorption may be performed, through gastric lavage or others measures that may minimize absorption (i.e. activated charcoal).\nThe clinically relevant fluid and electrolyte balance changes must be corrected. Along with the prevention and treatment of serious complications resulting from such imbalances and other effects in the body, this corrective action may require general and specific intensive medical monitoring and therapeutic measures.\nFurosemide is a potent loop diuretic which inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption at the Loop of Henl\u00e9. The drug eliminates both positive and negative free water production. Furosemide acts at the luminal face of the epithelial cells by inhibiting co-transport mechanisms for the entry of sodium and chloride. Furosemide gains access to its site of action by being transported through the secretory pathway for organic acids in the proximal tubule. It reduces the renal excretion of uric acid. Furosemide causes an increased loss of potassium in the urine and also increases the excretion of ammonia by the kidney.\nFurosemide is a weak carboxylic acid which exists mainly in the dissociated form in the gastro-intestinal tract. Furosemide is rapidly but incompletely absorbed (60-70%) on oral administration and its effect is largely over within four hours. The optimal absorption site is the upper duodenum at pH 5.0. Regardless of route of administration, 69-97% of activity from a radio-labelled dose is excreted in the first 4 hours after the drug is given. Furosemide is mainly eliminated via the kidneys (80-90%); a small fraction of the dose undergoes biliary elimination and 10-15% of the activity can be recovered from the faeces.\nWhen oral doses of Furosemide are given to normal subjects the mean bioavailability of the drug is approximately 52% but the range is wide. In plasma, Furosemide is extensively bound to proteins mainly to albumin. The unbound fraction in plasma averages 2 - 4% at therapeutic concentrations. The volume of distribution ranges between 170 - 270ml/Kg. The half life of the \u00df phase ranges from 45 - 60 min. The total plasma clearance is about 200ml/min. Renal excretion of unchanged drug and elimination by metabolism plus faecal excretion contribute almost equally to the total plasma clearance. Furosemide is in part cleared by the kidneys in the form of the glucuronide conjugate.\nDosing Device: 10ml oral syringe with 0.5ml graduation mark supplied with an LDPE syringe adaptor.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T12:42:09Z", "url": "https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/2460/smpc", "byte_size": 15528, "char_size": 15520}

{"text": "Provided is an Android app package EzDroid.apk.\nI typically use an Android emulator for testing, it\u2019s free and easy to install on all major platforms, so it\u2019s pretty much a no brainer.\nAfter installation, it looks like it maanges to start but exits shortly after, for some unknown reason. Looks like it is time to inspect the code.\nI like looking at high-level languages, so let\u2019s start with that first.\nBuildConfig and R are compile-time Android-generated classes, so ignore those.\nEZMain looks to be the main Activity class. If you are unfamiliar with Android, that\u2019s where the action happens.\nI don\u2019t have any dedicated programmers. I have been programming Atmel chips using the USB-to-serial bitbang method.\nRecently, I thought I\u2019d get one because doing a re-programming cycle is taking quite a bit of time (a disadvantage of serial port bitbanging).\nA popular one on Aliexpress seems to be this \u201cUSB ISP\u201d one, so I bought one. I chose this one because it has a nice aluminium case, and a pinout diagram imprinted on the case, which is handy. After having so many one-off projects with bare PCBs collecting dust, I now appreciate the importance of having projects in their own box or case.\nWhile it has \u201cUSBasp\u201d in the item name, it turns out that this was not a USBasp device, and getting it to work like one takes some effort.\navrdude does not recognize the device, even after creating an entry with the corresponding vendor/product ID. This particular device was designed to work with their Windows-based UI called ProgISP and will not work with avrdude.\nAnd apparently you can\u2019t just take the USBasp firmware and flash it into this device, because the circuit is somewhat different.\nDisassembling the device is simple. While grabbing the side of the case, firmly push the USB connector inwards and the board should slide out the other end. You can then gently pull the board out by the IDC connector.\nThe programmer seems to be based off of the popular USBasp programmer, but modified somewhat (to what end I\u2019m not sure). It lacks some features offered by other USBasp programmers, like the ability to control the target\u2019s clock, or to use 3.3V for certain targets. But at $2 with a nice aluminium case, what more can you ask for?\nIt\u2019s powered by an ATmega88 (I read that older versions were based on ATmega8). The markings on the board indicate that this is a MX-USBISP-V4.00. You can ignore tHe date because it was never updated; the older V3.02 also has the same date. While the GreenPhotons blog was talking about V3.00, I have verified that this version suffers from the same issue.\nNote that there are provisions on the PCB to add a voltage regulator, and the PCB link marked \u201cC\u201d can be cut to separate USB power from the rest of the system. Link \u201cD\u201d can be cut if you wish to disable target power. However, none of these options were used.\nThis causes the USB D- line to be actively driven from PD3, thereby impeding communication to/from the USB host.\nThe rest of this post will talk about (1) correcting this problem in USBasp, and (2) uploading the firmware into your zhifengsoft programmer.\nI have been running a software RAID array at home for some time now. It\u2019s a single network storage where I consolidate all my files. I manage this array manually using the mdadm command. Some people choose to buy a NAS storage box which hides all of the implementation details behind a nice Web GUI, but it\u2019s essentially the same thing under the hood.\nAs long as the other drives in the array doesn\u2019t develop bad sectors in the same stripe, the data can still be reconstructed from the remaining good blocks. This means that you can somewhat leave the drive as it is for a period without replacement, but of course you are taking a risk.\nI thought I\u2019d share my experiences with drive replacements thus far.\nMost Linux distributions provide the raid-check script for periodic RAID scrubbing. This is basically a background cron job that tells the kernel to start checking the RAID array. For RHEL/CentOS systems, this should occur every weekend.\nDuring this scrubbing process, all drives within the array are read and their parity blocks are computed, to ensure that everything tallies.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T09:03:53Z", "url": "http://irq5.io/2017/07/", "byte_size": 4239, "char_size": 4195}
{"text": "I\u2019ve seen several search engine topics involving schnauzers having symptoms of heart failure, and fainting, even when asleep. I\u2019ve been there with two of my schnauzers. My last one just died 12 days ago\u2026 always consult your vet with questions, but here is my experience. I\u2019m also an RN (disabled, but got my license 28 years ago and still have it). I was cued in to abnormal breathing and behaviors, which helped me know that I needed to get both of my dogs who had heart failure seen by their vets.\nMy first schnauzer to have heart failure was Hannah. I got her in 1988 as a 6 week old puppy. To make a sweater for her (there weren\u2019t many options for puppy clothes back then) I cut holes in one of my socks. She had some episodes that were called seizures, but with how things turned out, she probably had some heart issues starting at about 18 months old when she fainted (and twitched) for the first time. By the time I got her to the vet, she was fine. She had those episodes now and then, until 2000 when in one night she fainted 7 times (I stayed up with her all night). I thought I was taking her to the vet to be put to sleep that next morning, but he got her on some medications and prescription dog food and she lived another GOOD year. I vowed to not make her live just so I didn\u2019t have to face the loss of her. As a single woman with no kids, she was my family. I wanted the best for her, but when she died, it was really hard. She had done well up until the last couple of days; when she quit eating, I knew that was it. I had decided to get another dog before she died, so that kept me going.\nThen I got Mandy. She did very well until she was just about 11 years old. She fainted. Her breathing got too \u2018hard\u2019, and I knew what was going on. I took her to the vet, and with an exam and x-rays (showing an enlarged heart, displaced trachea- from the size of her heart, and some lung congestion) she was also diagnosed with canine heart failure. She was put on medications, and did fairly well. She only fainted 3 times total- including one time when she was asleep. The last \u2018episode\u2019 wasn\u2019t the same, but it was similar, and she died in my arms within 15 minutes. I still cry every day missing her.\nSomething huge to remember is to not give the dog \u2018people\u2019 food because of the salt content, unless it has no salt (which means that most processed foods are out). I got freeze dried peas (meant for toddlers) for Mandy, and she also loved freeze dried bananas (NOT the fried ones in the grocery store). Those items had NO added ingredients. She also liked pieces of raw apples. The only commercial treat she could have was \u201cCharlee Bear\u201d- because of the sodium content being low enough (I e-mailed the company for the answer re: sodium content, and then cleared it with my dog\u2019s vet- please check this out with your dog\u2019s vet as well \ud83d\ude42 Towards the very end, Mandy didn\u2019t want to eat. She had lost weight, so I tried various things- ground beef, ground turkey, scrambled eggs, rice, potatoes, oatmeal, baby food fruit and veggies\u2026. that last morning she had two Swedish meatballs that I\u2019d adjusted for her (low sodium and baked instead of fried- like the Christmas party meatballs were).\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see them get older and struggle. I made some mental notes as to when it was \u2018enough\u2019- though with Mandy it was a bit less clear until she just had a brief episode and then was actively dying in minutes. But I was prepared to have her put to sleep. Hannah died in my arms as she was euthanized. She knew I was there. That was important to me- I couldn\u2019t have either of them think I\u2019d left them. Mandy looked scared until she just collapsed in my lap. Then it was just a few minutes before it was over. I talked to her, and scratched behind her ears as I knew she liked.\nI\u2019m not sure what my malfunction is, but I\u2019m sorta grumpy. I got up way earlier than usual (I\u2019m one of those who is usually up half of the night and then sleeps until noon). I\u2019ve got a vague headache, but that\u2019s nothing all that new. I have chronic headaches. Christmas was really good- I got to see (and meet) family, and talked to my biological mom and half-brother on the phone, which is always good. I got to spend time with family at the Swedish Christmas party since I\u2019ve got the ice vest to wear when I leave home and don\u2019t have as much chance of being overheated because of the dysautonomia. And yet, I\u2019m a major dud this morning.\nI\u2019ve been extremely irritated at comments to news stories on various online sites and publications. So many people are so heartless and cruel. Or pathologically immature and even psychopathic. Responding that they\u2019re \u2018happy\u2019 about an article where five people were made homeless by a fire that destroyed their home? How do people get that way? Who dropped them on their head? Or burned them? And then there are the other \u2018less\u2019 disturbing posts that are just plain nasty and/or cruel. Or ignorant. I\u2019m actually very thankful I don\u2019t know those people or have to spend any IRL time with them. A click of the back button takes them out of my life.\nThe onslaught of horrible stories that are on the news constantly is also a major bummer. I feel really badly for those folks and what they\u2019re going through, but what good does it do anybody to have it dissected in the media for days to weeks on end? I\u2019ve been a crime survivor of a high profile case (before the 24/7 media, back in 1987). It wasn\u2019t helpful to see it on TV for days or see the newspaper coverage over and over. The people who knew about it, and were my actual friends/family already knew what happened, and face it: most people really don\u2019t want to know about real life horrors that happen to other people. Or they don\u2019t know what to do with the information, at least to the persons\u2019 face. Behind their back, the chatter won\u2019t stop. If people would have just asked me straight out what happened, or even if I wanted to talk about it would have been much more helpful than days of media coverage (without any input from me- I was an object). I had one \u2018different\u2019 neighbor that responded to meeting me with \u201cI never thought I\u2019d meet you ! \u201d Really? Meeting someone who has been raped and beaten was a life goal? Step away from the strange one !\nI\u2019m extremely disgusted with my weight, and have my food diary set up to start on January first. I don\u2019t want to look like this on my 50th birthday next November. I don\u2019t want to be grotesque and repulsive going into the last third to half of my life. I have to restrict food. I\u2019ve tried the \u2018normal\u2019 calorie amounts I\u2019ve been given from the doctor and diabetic dietician, and that doesn\u2019t work\u2026so I\u2019ve got to go lower. I can\u2019t do much exercise because of the issue with passing out when my heart rate goes up or I get overheated, and my knees and spine issues. So the calories have to go. A slippery slope for me, so I\u2019ve got to be careful- but I have to DO something beyond what I\u2019ve been doing. I didn\u2019t look like this before chemo\u2026 and I want to lose any remnants of those days.\nLosing weight will also save me some time before having to have my left knee replaced (I had the right one done in late 2006, and it was a very unpleasant experience with some complications and \u2018dull\u2019 response time by the doc and nurses to a bladder infection). I had to go to a rehab place for the medically defective. It was a good rehab facility- great care, but set up where people stayed in their rooms like a hospital between therapies (no common area), and since I was infective, I was in a private room- not a horrible thing, but friggin\u2019 isolated. It\u2019s not like there was a big risk of someone coming into contact with my pee. My left knee has unrepaired, and questionably healed ACL and medial meniscus tears, done when I turned over in bed back in 2009- about a week before my closest friend from here in this town died suddenly (following several complications from a KNEE replacement). She\u2019d moved to a different state to be closer to one of her daughters, but we were in contact by phone daily, even when she was in the hospital or rehab. I was supposed to have the left knee replacement done, but then got leukemia and everything was put on hold to survive that. Been a weird few years.\nI\u2019m frustrated that I don\u2019t feel that people understand why I\u2019m like I am. I\u2019ve got diagnoses that people haven\u2019t heard of. I \u2018look\u2019 like I\u2019m capable of working, and I miss being a nurse SO much- but too much standing or walking, and the whole heat/heart rate thing = one unconscious middle-aged RN. I\u2019ve been an RN for nearly 28 years. I\u2019ve been on disability for 8 years. But I still keep my license, because I still AM an RN. I worked hard for that thing. And I loved working with it\u2026 And those days are done. When people ask me what I\u2019m doing to get back to work, it hurts- there isn\u2019t anything that can be done by me or anyone else. Some things CAN\u2019T BE FIXED ! SO those perky, blessed-to-be-clueless people need to shut up and go target someone who has some stuff going on that is treatable. I\u2019ve been dealing with much of this since 1996- and worked until 2004- I held out as long as I could. I fought to keep working. QUIT asking me if I\u2019m going back to work. NO, I can\u2019t !\nI was raised in an evangelical church, and am a born again Christian, without some of the judgmental drama that can go with those two things. I hate the passive \u2018I\u2019ll pray for you\u2019 stuff- prayer is wonderful, and I do it often, but if someone wants to help, some action would be really amazing ! Prayer is about as passive as a person can get and rationalize to themselves that they\u2019re \u2018doing\u2019 something\u2013 and while I do believe in prayer and that it is a very positive and powerful thing (and pray for people on the news all of the time since I can\u2019t do anything else), it\u2019s not the be-all end-all answer to really being of use to someone. It\u2019s definitely better than nothing, but it really doesn\u2019t show much in terms of actively supporting and helping someone. Sometimes it\u2019s all people CAN do- and that\u2019s appreciated. But remember the \u2018faith without works is dead\u2019? I\u2019ve sensed a lot of dead. I wish I could do more for others, and feel guilty about that. Not like I know many people around here to be available for\u2026 back in the home where my heart is, I could be more useful, even if I\u2019m not that physically \u2018able\u2019\u2026 I could drive someone to the store, or appointments. I could water plants when they were gone, or change out cat litter. I couldn\u2019t walk dogs or watch kids\u2026 but I\u2019d do what I could.\nAnyway, that\u2019s a bit of what\u2019s rattling through my head today. I\u2019m a little less grumpy now.\nHannah was my present to myself for my 25th birthday. She was a salt and pepper miniature schnauzer. I\u2019d gone and picked her out from her litter when she was about 4 weeks old. When she was \u2018ready\u2019 at 7 weeks old, I drove out to Lake Travis (near Austin, TX) in a raging thunderstorm in November 1988, and got her. She and her littermates were all standing up on the covered patio with their dog mama, peeking in the French doors into the house. They were all so cute, but she walked over to me first when the door was opened. She seemed to remember!\nShe was so funny when she was little. I didn\u2019t have the heart to make her sleep by herself, and since she was a \u2018baby\u2019 didn\u2019t want her peeing in my bed. I put her into a regular baby bassinet that a neighbor had given to me, and put it next to my bed. She\u2019d give a good puppy howl if she was scared, and as soon as I draped my hand into the bassinet, she\u2019d quiet down and go back to sleep. After a couple of nights, she seemed to understand that I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. As soon as she was potty trained, she slept in bed with me.\nHannah was about 2 years old when she had her first \u2018seizure\u2019. By the time I got her to the vet, the vet looked at me like I was a bit on the overprotective side. Hannah was fine, and just stared at both of us. Back home\u2026 She continued to have these \u2018seizures\u2019 on and off for years. They never happened more than 2-3 times a year, so from what the vet had said about risk/benefits of medication, I opted to keep her off of meds. She always bounced back as if nothing had happened.\nWhen Hannah was 11 1/2 years old, she scared me out of my mind. One single night, she passed out seven times. I was up all night with her. She\u2019d get sort of woozy and stagger a bit and, then fall over on her side, twitching. She\u2019d then stagger to her feet and have to go out to pee immediately. Like right now. I thought for sure she was dying. She slept on the couch next to me that whole night between episodes. She had stopped eating the day before (which was very unlike her), but initially I thought it was some bug. I watched her, and she didn\u2019t have any vomiting or diarrhea\u2026 but then that night. Oy. I thought it was the end.\nAs soon as the vet\u2019s office opened I called, and got her right in. We lived in a small town from the time she was 7 years old; they didn\u2019t have an emergency animal hospital there at the the time. I was glad her regular vet saw her. He asked me to leave her there for a few hours so he could figure out what was going on. I agreed, but I hated leaving her. She was my only companion. My best friend.\nI got the call to come and get her (good news) and when I got there the vet told me that she was in heart failure. Grade 4 murmur ( a \u20185\u2019 is the worst). He\u2019d given her oxygen and a shot of a strong diuretic (water pill medicine), and she\u2019d peed off a bunch of fluid her heart couldn\u2019t circulate through her body normally, to be eliminated through her kidneys. I got prescription dog food, three medicines to give her by mouth, and a bottle of the diuretic medicine to give her as a shot if she needed a \u2018booster\u2019 to help her breathing, and the syringes and needles for her shots. He knew I was an RN, so giving shots wasn\u2019t a problem. He just showed me where on the back of her neck to give them.\nShe also couldn\u2019t have regular dog treats, or anything with a \u2018normal\u2019 sodium level. I got her some low-sodium peanut butter (to hide her pills in). She didn\u2019t like it. She also didn\u2019t like the prescription \u2018heart\u2019 diet food, so the rest of that case of cans was returned, and she got the \u2018kidney\u2019 food. It had limited sodium like the \u2018heart\u2019 diet. And she got grapes (this was about 10 years before I found out that dogs shouldn\u2019t have grapes). She LOVED those grapes. I\u2019d sneak her pills into them, and she acted like I\u2019d given her filet mignon and truffles.\nShe did very well, and had many, many days where she was playing, and acting like she felt really good. She knew the names of her individual toys, and would get them, and enjoy chasing them. She still howled when I was on the phone to my folks; my mom had dementia, and one thing SHE still enjoyed was Hannah howling at her on the phone when I said \u201cwoof\u201d, or \u201cbow wow\u201d. I just had to say the words, and she\u2019d do her howling bit. Mom loved it !\nHannah, and the toy named \u201cWeirdo\u201d- feeling better !\nHannah still had an occasional fainting episode, but within a few minutes (and a quick trip outside to pee) was back to her normal self. I had told the vet that I would NOT put my best friend through a miserable year just because I couldn\u2019t say goodbye. If she wasn\u2019t going to have any quality of life, forget it. But he was right- she had some very good months left in her.\nAbout 11 months later, I noticed her start to change not long after moving to a different apartment in the same complex. She started not wanting to eat, and her breathing was getting funky. I gave her the shots to get rid of the fluid (and it did). But it wasn\u2019t working as well. I had told myself when she was diagnosed that if she started to refuse food completely, that was it. We were done. The shots were only helping for about a half a day, and I had to give them to her a couple of times a day for 4-5 days. Then she completely stopped eating. My heart started to break. That night, her breathing was horrible. I knew what was coming.\nIn the morning, she got off of the bed, and peed on the floor. Then she went and hid in my closet, as if to say she was so ashamed. I couldn\u2019t get mad at her, she was sick ! It was pitiful to see her hiding from her accident. She NEVER peed on the floor- she was so good about waiting to go outside, or using the pee pads when I left her in the kitchen to go to work. I knew I had to take her to the vet.\nI sat on the couch before getting ready to load her into the car. She got up on the couch with me, and climbed on my lap. She ended up sitting on my thigh, and then putting her head on my shoulder. I think she was saying goodbye, and it was easier for her to breathe if she was upright, but didn\u2019t have to support herself. I loaded her into a laundry basket to put in the car, since her balance was a little iffy. When I took her in to the vet, he said he\u2019d like to try some more oxygen and medications, and he\u2019d call me. I told him that I could be back there in minutes if it looked like she was getting worse (she was already bad), and he agreed that he\u2019d call me if I needed to come. I did not want her dying without knowing I was there, and I hadn\u2019t just dropped her off and deserted her.\nI got the call around 11:30 a.m. I had the kind of desk nursing job where there was flexibility for such things. I\u2019d told my boss ahead of time what was going on, so when I told the receptionist I had to leave I could just go.\nWhen I got there, Hannah was hooked up to an IV, oxygen, rectal probe (temperature), and heart monitor. She looked spent. But she also lifted her head a little when she heard my voice. She knew I was there. I was told to take whatever time I needed, but I think when she put her head on my shoulder earlier that morning, that was our time. Right then, I had to do what was best for her, so I started taking the equipment off of her, and just holding her. I was satisfied she knew I was there, and that it was OK for her to stop fighting. I told the vet to just \u2018do it\u2019.\nShe slowly dropped her head as the \u2018go to sleep\u2019 stuff took effect. I could feel her full weight against my arms, and then she took her last breath. It was over. My best friend was gone. I was told that I could spend time with her. (the vet\u2019s office had cleared out for lunch, aside from those who were helping Hannah\u2026 and they were all in tears as well). I could hardly see her through the tears, but I did want to hold her for just a few minutes. They let me take her to one of the exam rooms where it was quiet, and private. I just cried, and told her how much I loved her, and how wonderful she\u2019d been as my best friend. I wasn\u2019t in that little room with her for very long.

{"text": "Lymph node enlargement is a common feature in a variety of diseases and may serve as a focal point for subsequent clinical investigation of diseases of the reticuloendothelial system or regional infection. The majority of cases represent a benign response to localized or systemic infection. Most children with lymphadenitis exhibit small, palpable cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes. Less common is enlargement of the suboccipital or postauricular nodes. Palpable supraclavicular, epitrochlear, and popliteal lymph nodes are uncommon, as are enlarged mediastinal and abdominal nodes.\nLymphadenitis may affect a single node or a group of nodes (regional adenopathy) and may be unilateral or bilateral.

Thank you for everything.\nMichael and I loved working with Nicole and Mike; they made taking pictures in the cold enjoyable and made us feel comfortable. Awesome people to work with, and highly recommended.\nWe had Nicole & Mike do our engagement and wedding photos. They were professional, personal and truly captured our vision!

If you've seen their work you know that they are seriously talented, know the technical elements of photography, and have a natural eye. The bonus is their professionalism and flexibility. They were so open to all our crazy ideas and were really diligent about making our vision come to life, but they were also honest about what wouldn't work or come out the way we wanted. They are so fun to be around, our whole session felt like hanging out with (super talented) old friends.\n\u201cDon't think I could have done it with out them...\"\nMike & Nicole did our engagement pictures so of course they had to do our wedding, and we were not disappointed.

I honestly don't think I could have done it with out them. Our pictures came out beautifully, and I can't thank them enough!!\nThey were the absolute best pair to shoot our trash the dress evening. Very laid back when we were 30 minutes late stuck in traffic and the best warm-hearted people. They captured every moment we hoped they would and then some. We now have memories frozen in which we can cherish forever. Thanks to both of you so much and look forward to using you in the future. Cheers!\n\u201cStill raving about the photos...\"\nNicole & Mike did a wonderful job photographing our big day! My friends and family are still raving about the photos they took.

I'm extremely happy with the work they did for our wedding!\nI can not thank Nicole & Mike enough!!! From the moment I messaged them, they have been so amazing. Even after I was an hour late to my wedding, they worked with me. I was in the middle of a break down due to heavy rain and some family drama, but they were there to calm me down and reassure me everything would be ok.

{"text": "Q. Flying to Brockville from the United States: As a U.S. citizen, must I bring a passport?\nA. A passport is the best identification to present at Canada Customs but it's not a requirement to visit Canada. Proof of citizenship through a birth certificate is adequate.\nQ. I'd like to bring a few gifts in when I come. Is there a limit on their value?\nA. Gifts are restricted to a value of $60.00 Canadian per recipient. They cannot include alcohol or tobacco products. Should the value be in excess of $60.00 you can expect to pay the regular duties on the excess amount.\nQ. May I bring along my favourite alcohol or tobacco products?\nA. The minimum drinking age in Ontario is 19 years. Visitors who are 19 or older may carry up to 40 oz. of wine or liquor or 24 (12 oz) cans or bottles of beer or ale. They may also bring up to 50 cigars or 200 cigarettes. This is what Canadian Customs considers to be a reasonable amount for one's personal use.\nQ. Wherever we go, we take our family pet, even in the aircraft. Is this a problem?\nA. Not as long as Spot doesn't bite the officer! One or two domesticated cats or dogs travelling with the owner can be brought into Canada without a permit, provided they are accompanied by a rabies vaccination certificate. Pet food is also permitted.\nQ. Our daughter wants her best friend to come along. Will Canada Customs object?\nA. Do not be surprised if Canadian Customs officials talk to the children or ask you questions about them. Keep in mind that they are looking for missing children. Children should have proof of nationality and a letter from their parents that can verify their reason for travelling. Visiting Canada can be a rewarding and enjoyable learning experience for children. Include them in your family holiday to Brockville this summer.\nQ. Will I be able to bring fire-arms into Canada?\nA. Every year thousands of American sportsmen travel North to hunt in Canada. They should know in advance that handguns and automatic firearms are restricted weapons in Canada and should be left at home. Canadians are required to carry a Firearms Acquisition Certificate. U.S. visitors should bring along their local equivalent indicating that they are authorized to own a firearm.\nQ. Every 4th of July we set off fireworks. Can I bring some with me to Canada?\n(613)995-2388 for the \u201cbegin_of_the_skype_highlighting\u201d and \u201cend_of_the_skype_highlighting\u201d. We would also suggest that you buy your fireworks locally from a Canadian retailer. Canadians also enjoy fireworks. In fact, we have a wonderful display during Brockville's annual Riverfest celebration, usually on July 1.\nQ. Would I have to pay duties? Is it difficult?\nA. Yes, you would have to pay duties on\u2026? It is simple and straightforward. You can use cash, traveller's cheques or, if you have the proper identification, you can write personal cheques for amounts of $500 or less. VISA and Mastercard are also accepted.\nQ. How do I arrange for a Canada Customs clearance at the Brockville - 1000 Islands Regional Tackaberry Airport and later re-enter the United States?\nTravellers on a Canadian or U.S. registered private, company-owned, or small charter aircraft carrying no more than 15 passengers may clear Canadian Customs at Brockville.\nThis notification must be at least one hour prior to, but no more than 72 hours prior to landing in Brockville.\nThe pilot will be asked the names, birthdates, and citizenship of his passengers.\nAfter landing at Brockville, the pilot shall make his way to the terminal, a single story, circular building and telephone the same 1-888-CANPASS (226-7277) for \u201cbegin_of_the_skype_highlighting\u201d and \u201cend_of_the_skype_highlighting\u201d number.\nThe pilot will either be given a telephone clearance into Canada or told to await the arrival of a Customs officer.\nPlease contact Canada Customs at 1-888-CANPASS begin_of_the_skype_highlighting 1-888-CANPASS end_of_the_skype_highlighting 2 hours in advance of your arrival to determine if an Officer can meet you at the Airport and what the call out fee will be.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T02:52:05Z", "url": "http://www.brockvilleairport.com/submaster.cfm?aPage=printer.cfm&ID=83", "byte_size": 4059, "char_size": 4041}

{"text": "(Remember) when the angels said: \"O Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him (God), whose name is the Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, revered in this world and the Hereafter, and one of those brought near (to God). He will speak to the people from his cradle and as a man, and he is of the righteous.\" She said: \"My Lord, how can I have a child when no mortal has touched me?\" He said: \"So (it will be). God creates what He wills. If He decrees a thing, He says to it only, 'Be!' and it is.\"\nThe case of Jesus with God is like the case of Adam. He created him from dust, and then He said to him, \"Be!\" and he came into being.\n\"I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. I make for you the shape of a bird out of clay, I breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by God's permission. I heal the blind from birth and the leper. And I bring the dead to life by God's permission. And I tell you what you eat and what you store in your houses....\"\nNeither Muhammad \u0003 nor Jesus came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in one God, brought by earlier prophets, but rather to confirm and renew it.\nMuslims also believe that God revealed a holy book to Jesus called the Injeel, some parts of which may be still available in the teachings of God to Jesus in the New Testament. But this does not mean that Muslims believe in the Bible we have today because it is not the original scriptures that were revealed by God. They underwent alterations, additions, and omissions.\nThis was also said by the Committee charged with revising The Holy Bible (Revised Standard Version). This Committee consisted of thirty-two scholars who served as members of the Committee. They secured the review and counsel of an Advisory Board of fifty representatives of the co-operating denominations. The Committee said in the Preface to The Holy Bible (Revised Standard Version), p. iv: \"Sometimes it is evident that the text has suffered in transmission, but none of the versions provides a satisfactory restoration. Here we can only follow the best judgement of competent scholars as to the most probable reconstruction of the original text.\" The Committee also said in the Preface, p. vii: \"Notes are added which indicate significant variations, additions, or omissions in the ancient authorities (Mt 9.34; Mk 3.16; 7.4; Lk 24.32, 51, etc.).\"\nBid'ah (innovation) in Islam is defined as any invented way in religion that is aimed at worshipping or drawing closer to Allaah subhanahu wata'ala. This means anything that is not referred to specifically in Sharee'ah, and for which there is no evidence (daleel) in the Qur'aan or Sunnah, and which was not known at the time of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and his Companions. At the same time, it is quite obvious that this definition of religious inventions or innovations, which are condemned, does not include worldly inventions [such as cars and washing machines, etc. - Translator].", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T21:01:28Z", "url": "https://www.linktoislam.net/islamic-articles/article.aspx?id=47", "byte_size": 2924, "char_size": 2924}
{"text": "The sun slowly sinks in the sky, touching the spot where the water meets the sky in a spectacular blast of colors. No Instagram filter needed here! Bring the ohana \u2013 family \u2013 and experience these amazing sunsets for yourself from the private lanai of Poipu Palms 302.\nInside, you\u2019ll find new furnishings and new wood laminate flooring. Open and airy, the fully-equipped kitchen has everything you\u2019ll need for meal prep, including coffee and condiments. Having the ocean right out the kitchen window while your cooking doesn\u2019t hurt either!\nSit down for meals at the 4-person dining table, with room for 2 more at the kitchen bar. The oceanfront views continue in the living room, where floor-to-ceiling patio doors let the outside in. Crash on the couch or armchair, doing a little channel surfing on the flat-screen TV with cable.\nBoth bedrooms have fun tropical d\u00e9cor, queen beds and en-suite bathrooms, ideal for two couples traveling together. You also get all the comforts of home with amenities like Wi-Fi, washer and dryer, linens and beach towels and starter kit of paper and cleaning supplies.\n1. Sea Turtles, Dolphins and Whales\u2026Oh My!: Grab a front-row seat on the private lanai to an amazing show. From your perch on the top floor, you\u2019ll see turtles and dolphins play in the waves year round, and humpback whales swim through the area in the winter months.\n2. Upscale Pool and Deck: Clear your schedule\u2026you\u2019re going to want to spend all day soaking up the sun on the gorgeous deck with multiple levels, tiki hut and lounge chairs. Splash down in the plunge pool to cool off with the waves of the Pacific rolling in the background.\n3. Quiet Condo Complex: Part of the intimate Poipu Palms community, the condo is one of 12 and sits on the top floor for privacy, peace and quiet.\nGather up the beach chairs, umbrellas and sand toys and walk the 10 minutes down to pretty Poipu Beach. If you\u2019ve got enough stuff for an army, pack up the car instead and make the quick 2-minute drive.\nIf you want to get the blood pumping, hike the Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail, which is chock full of amazing photo stops perfect for Instagramming. Adrenaline junkies will love zip lining, aerial obstacle courses and a wide variety of watersports.\nThe building from the street view looks a little dated. The unit itself is very nice. It is updated and fresh. Very clean. The rear wood deck is beautiful tropical hard wood.The view is spectacular. You feel like you are on the water. --- Mahalo, Ben!\nBalkony, Location, Pool and View are wonderful! Apartment could have been cleaner, still we had a very nice stay!\nPoipu Palms 302 is just as advertised - lovely views out into a cove (we watched a lot of sea turtles and even saw a few spinner dolphins passing through). There are effectively two suites, which gave us plenty of room to spread out and would give two couples enough privacy. The lanai and living room were wonderful places to relax. An easy walk (0.5 mi) to the Grand Hyatt (several restaurants and a beach) or Brenneckes Bar (laid back) and beach-front park. Everything was clean and the kitchen had everything we needed for breakfast, lunches or a simple dinner. The condo was in a quiet area - no noisy neighbors and (somehow!) none of the roosters Kauai is infamous for. GVR is great to work with - very responsive and helped with a few special requests.\nMy friend had a medical emergency the day after we arrived, and my attempts to reach 911 didn't work; I'm not sure why. Not knowing what else to do, I called the GVR office to explain what was happening, and Janie (I think it was Janie) stayed on the line with me while contacting the paramedic squad. Within 5 minutes, the emt crew was there, and shortly after that, Mark arrived to ask if there was anything he or GVR could do. That gesture meant a great deal. He stayed for at least half an hour, to make sure we were OK. Thank goodness my friend recovered and we were able to enjoy the rest of our vacation. Everyone at GVR was so friendly and helpful, and genuinely interested in making our stay a pleasant one. MANAGER RESPONSE: We are so glad that everything worked out for your friend. What a scary experience! Glad we could help in anyway possible. We hope to see you again!\nWe enjoyed everything about the property! The location is superb; the amenities (including the wonderful-smelling toiletries!) are great. Having dishwasher detergent and Tide pods supplied was a plus. The lovely dishes added so much ambiance with their colorful fish and ocean design. The balcony was perfectly situated to allow the best ocean view, and we spent many relaxing hours there, just watching the waves come and go. Very peaceful and quiet! MANAGER RESPONSE: Mahalo! We hope to see you again soon!\nVery impressed. Bruce was my \"goto\" guy and was very attentive and responsive. We had one issue that was NOT related to the property itself or GVR but a different property manager on a unit below ours. I contacted Bruce and he instantly got things resolved and came up with a resolution. It was over and beyond what I expected.\nThis property is very well equipped with little amenities that made it very special. The furnishings and condition of this rental is extremely nice. It will be a great pleasure to any and all who stay here.\nOur stay at Puipo Palms was great! The location was unbeatable with awesome views. The pool, though small, was never crowded and has beautiful ocean views. You could hear and see the waves crashing (and sea turtles swimming!) right from the patio. The beach was an easy 5 minute drive with easy parking or 10-15 minute walk. The beach was great for snorkeling (we even swam with sea turtles and saw the monk seals playing in the water 20 feet from us!) The waves can be intense but this beach is well protected and great for kiddos though not crowded. Breneckes restaurant right across the street had the best lunch and drinks! There are plenty of shops and other restaurants another 5 minutes down the road. The only complaint we had is that one of the beds is so firm we opted to sleep on the couch instead. The other bed, though softer, squeaked and sagged a little. We informed the hosts and they came out and looked at them. They did some adjusting to the bed that squeaked and we didn't have any trouble after that but we still didn't sleep on the firm one. If you're looking for a place to stay with awesome beds, this might not be the one for you. The internet was also a little spotty if you had more than a couple devices connected. Otherwise the apartment was clean and the kitchen was well stocked, complete with a blender. The only thing we were missing was a coffee grinder and they brought us one right away when we asked. They provide a list of farmers markets to attend and great reference books for what to do on the island. We would definitely stay in Poipu again!\nLovely stay. We had a great surprise when we saw the pool. You should promote it in the property description.\nThe view is unbelievable! we saw dolphins and sea turtle right out the balcony.\nNever actually spoke to them personally, just emailing back and forth. Great response from everyone with answers to my questions, etc. And I asked about a possible early check in because we were going to arrive early- I was about to call and actually got a text that it was ready. Great timing!!\nBeautiful spot, close to the beach and short drive to shopping/restaurants. Nice and clean and well stocked with everything you need. Great lanai to just sit and watch the ocean. Very comfortable beds and lots of room. Lots of fans and the set up of the windows lets the air move around the condo nicely- never got hot inside! Pool area was adequate- not a large pool, but nice to take a dip in -I'd rather be at the beach anyway ;) Overall excellent stay!!\nGreat location and price. Right on the water and right up the street from Poipu beach. Had everything you needed in a rental and was very comfortable. GVR was great at communicating check in info and making sure we had everything we needed. Highly recommend staying here.\nExcellent stay with all amenities included. Lots of kitchen utensils and beach gear, the staff have definitely thought of everything so you can have a worry-free vacation and feel at home.\nEach team member was extremely helpful. They answered all of my questions promptly and with a positive attitude. They were all very friendly.\nAs always, our stay in Poipu Palms was excellent. We enjoyed the beautiful views and the great condo. We were impressed with the amenities available such as shampoos, conditions, soap (which smelled wonderful), toilet paper, paper towels, etc. The staff was extremely helpful with making sure we had everything we needed and were comfortable. This was our first trip with our daughter (she is 1) and this area was perfect. We were able to have a pak n play delivered to use before we even arrived, enjoyed taking her to the newly remodeled pool area which was great and was even able to do a late checkout which was so very helpful with hour daughter. I enjoyed the welcoming and departing text messages-very thoughtful!!! We will be back soon :) MANAGER'S RESPONSE: I am so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us. Our goal is to be sure our guests are enjoying themselves while staying with us. I hope you get an opportunity to come back and stay with us again someday -- and bring you daughter!!!\nThis team was amazing. I tend to have a lot of questions and want to make sure every box is checked, and sometimes rechecked. They were so helpful and always responded in a timely manor. I loved that they texted me as soon as we landed that our condo was ready for us to check in and to let me know what number to contact if I had any more questions. MANAGER RESPONSE: Mahalo for your review! So happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay. Also, it i nice to hear that our texting service is helpful. It is sort of new for us and we love it! Hope to see you again soon.\nThis property was fantastic! its a small 12 unit complex so we never felt like there were too many people around. The unit was perfect for us and had everything we needed to make us feel like we were at home. We loved laying by the pool at the end of the day and watching the turtles below. The one thing I would like to mention is that the grill is a charcoal grill and the coals were sometimes hard to keep lit due to the breeze. There is also no cover for it so it takes a little longer for somethings to cook.\nThey were always really nice and got back to me within a reasonable amount of time. The unit number they originally sent me was not accurate but once I called they were easily able to figure it out and everything went perfectly after that.\nThe view was fantastic. We were able to see a whale spouting as well as dolphins from our balcony.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T01:06:22Z", "url": "https://www.alohagvr.com/property/poipu-palms-302", "byte_size": 10863, "char_size": 10842}

{"text": "I used to strive for long, flowing blonde hair. I always had longish hair as a child and always feared getting it chopped off. However, recently I took the gradual journey to short hair and I don't regret a thing.\n1. Long hair is hard to maintain.\nIf you have, or want nice long hair you know you need to keep it healthy, duh. When you're like me and like to change your hair every so often, you will likely incur some damage which can make the hair feel as dead as it looks. I also found that long hair knots and matts so easily whereas with short hair that issue hasn't occurred for me. I do however have the constant 'oh, I miss my long hair' thoughts so if you are wanting long Haim like hair, LOOK AFTER YO' LOCKS.\nI have had numerous encounters with friends who have said short hair suits my face shape better but also makes me look my age, rather than looking younger. I do now look at some photos and react with a 'I GENUINELY LOOK 12 AND THIS WAS TAKEN THIS YEAR' remark.\n4. If you need a change, your hair is a good option.\nSounds silly but something as simple as a hair cut can be the small change you need to be happier. Like in TV shows when there's a break up so the character has an image change, it can be a real mood and confidence booster. YOU OWN IT.\nIf you really want to just go for it, go for it. Start off gradual and see what works, or what doesn't. At the end of the day, your hair will always grow back.\nIt really suits you! I know for a fact that short hair doesn't look good on me, so I'm striving for that long hair again!\nI wear hair extensions at the mo as I want my hair to rival Rapunzel's, but I do have random moments where I envy girls with shorter hair. It looks stunning on you, think you've found the perfect length!\nIt looks so great on you and this post makes me so tempted!", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T16:07:42Z", "url": "http://www.trudyjohanna.co.uk/2015/06/5-reasons-why-you-should-cut-your-hair.html", "byte_size": 1815, "char_size": 1815}

{"text": "Discussion in 'CNC Mills/Routers' started by getoffmyland, Jun 3, 2015.\nA modified OX based on Aluminum plates cut on a waterjet. Some new ideas and additions from other builds are included.\nI am now having a look at cutting and squaring the v-slot.\nAny suggestions on the best way?\nMy preferred choice at the moment is to make a jig for the router that allows a square vertical cut across the end of the v-slot that I can \"feed\" the v-slot into. once one end is square on all pieces I can setup a stop at the far end, set the v-slot in and nibble away to make square and to length.\nI set up a simple V-slot jig to trim ends with. Worked fairly well.\nThe plate you see at the far end was used to gang multiple similar pieces together so all would be trimmed to the same length. I'd trim one end and then rotate the whole piece and do the other.\nMark Carew, GrayUK and getoffmyland like this.\n@getoffmyland looks great what kind of aluminum? How thick is the aluminum? And final question are you happy with it?\nI think its 3150... thats what I was told but could be anything, feels strong enough.\nAt the moment I am really happy with it, I guess I wont really be sure until it is fully built and tested. I am still waiting for some screws and bits so I will not know if I have everything in the right spot but I figured it would be a learning process and once I have a machine up and running then version 2 can be started.\nYesterday I tapped some v-slot (broke the tap on the last hole) so need to either try and remove or go with plan b which is leave that bolt out or use an extra angle bracket there.\nFor the work involved and with the equipment I have its just not worth it. So I tried a scotch brite pad and got a decent brushed finish that looks a lot better. so I am going to remove the major scratches and have a brushed look.\nI am surprised that would be strong enough. I guess the plates are not that big. Good to know Thanks for the info.\nTry using a DA sander with like about 80 grit. Leaves a matte finish that hides scratches really giod!!!\nI finally got some time to work on the CNC again.... well, I sorted out a \"workshop\" with some cheap ikea tables and shelves so I am not working on the floor.\nI also started to look at the electronics side of things..... got a parallel post card so I had to do a quick test.\nAnyhow, I hooked up 1 stepper and got it moving...... great!!!!\nso now I am trying to work out the setting and setup..... I have read loads and I think I have a good idea where to start.\n3. Mach 3 - I have not even begun to look at settings and tuning... any tips?\nI read a load of things(mostly bad/do do it) about the stepper drivers... I will eventually upgrade to Gecko when I have the cash.... but one question..... I noticed the stepper and driver getting warm... almost hot to the touch..... what is normal for these?\nmach3 videos on yt. Paul Campbell is the. channel name....I think.\nThe motors and drivers do get warm sometimes hot. They heat up the most when they're powered but not moving. some drivers will cut some of the motor current when they aren't being commanded. This reduces heat. If they're too hot to touch then you probably should dial down on the current. getting some airflow to them is a plus. If possible, heatsinking the drivers also helps.\nI have watched a few videos but good to know the \"guy\" to watch.\nI read a load of things(montly bad/do do it) about the stepper drivers... I will eventually upgrade to Gecko when I have the cash.... but one question..... I noticed the stepper and driver getting warm... almost hot to the touch..... what is normal for these?\nSo, those \"drivers\" are already heatsinked. One problem I've read on them is that there isn't thermal paste between the driver and heatsink. Some users have found that the dip switch settings dont match up with what is printed and others have found that it does! There also seems to be idle current issues where the driver is either stuck in 30% current or never goes into current reduction.\nAt this point I think you should figure out what kinda of personality your drives have then work on the relationship from there or reconsider it entirely.\nIt's not unusual for motors and drives to be hot. No offense to getoffmyland, but the package he is using is the greatest or most efficient. Its probably why they're sinked to begin with. There are a lot of variables. Enclosure size, machine environment, power supply, load vs. motor characteristics, driver capabilities, etc. Depending on the scenario, adding a heatsink or fan may be necessary and isn't uncommon.\nQ.) How should I heatsink my drive?\nA.) There is not drive-specific heatsink for any Geckodrive, and there are a variety of ways to heatsink your drive. What you should do is ensure that your heatsink has fins to increase surface area, and have air flowing over it. A good heatsink to use is a standard CPU heatsink with some heatsink compound in between the drive\u2019s plate and the finned aluminum heatsink. The method to determining if it is being cooled adequately is to feel the drive while it is running. If it is uncomfortable to the touch, then the electronics are uncomfortable as well.\nEven though they do not heatsink their drivers, they do realize that it may be necessary under certain circumstances.\nIn the end, it's not unusual for a correctly sized stepper motor and drive to produce a bit of heat around room temp. There are a number of variables to consider when determining why things are heating up and if action should be taken. The tb6600 package might need to be revaluated by getoffmyland. There is certainly some inspection and additional reading to be done. They aren't the best drivers as they seem riddled with problems overall, but if you're on a budget and theyre working for ya, then hey! Adding a fan and/or heatsinking may just be key.\nI measured the temps on drivers and motors during intensive cutting at ambient temperature of 42 degrees Celsius (!!); the motors didn't go over 50 Celsius and the driver boards were around 48 Celsius (in closed box with two fans, one extracting the other blowing air in). Drivers TB6600 http://www.hotmcu.com/tb6600-1-axis...l?cPath=7_30&zenid=7h0gfih59sfgr61lvjsj9g9kn5 are doing good, but others I had before were total crap. Going for good drivers straight away (Gecko or Leadshine) looks expensive but will save you in the longer run.\nI changed a few settings and did some motor tuning and the temps have cooled down.\nI have done extensive reading on the Drives I have and know about the problems and other issues around them. It was a risk getting them but for the price I was willing to try it just to get me running. It looks like there are various versions and if you get good ones they are not that bad. I look to have good ones where the dip switches are correct and I have good heat sink contact with paste.\nI think the main issue is they are enabled all the time and when there is no movement it generates some heat... I am going to look at using the enable pins to switch to an idle mode.\nJames_Hopkins and GrayUK like this.\ni have started mine and i'm documenting with pics i will open a thread soon.i got some plates from chris on ebay.\nbut i'm interested in having more made that i will be doing some tinkering here and there.\nto bad out here where i live we don't have any water cutting places.\nand my build is not even done yet to the point where i can try to route some of then.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T09:09:15Z", "url": "https://openbuilds.com/threads/water-buffalo-water-jet-cut-ox.1926/", "byte_size": 7453, "char_size": 7451}

{"text": "Over my holiday I had the extreme luxury of reading some of the stoic literature I had. Particularly the lecture series of Gaius Musonius Rufus one of the Roman stoics. From his 21 discourses, discourse 18 labelled \u201cOn Food\u201d is what caught my attention. Now I don\u2019t agree with many of Musonius practical stoic ideas, such as not eating meat, but there is one piece of advice he gives, that has stuck with me.\nIn Discourse 18, Musonius advises that we listen to Socrates and not live to eat, but rather eat to live. What he means here, is that food is just that, it\u2019s food. That is, rather than constantly be thinking about what you are eating, we should treat eating as what it is, something we must do to survive.\nI am sure most of us, if not all, have come across the judgemental individuals who will pipe up with something along the lines of \u201cwhy deprive yourself of food\u201d or \u201cyou only live once\u201d or whatever other justification they use every time we politely refuse a piece of cake or a bowl of spaghetti. To these people I often echo Musonius, and mention that not eating a caramel slice is not deprivation to me. I eat so I can enjoy life, I don\u2019t enjoy life by eating.\nA lot of us paleo dieters fall into an orthorexic lifestyle. We obsess about our food. This is not a healthy mindset by any means, and is just as bad as eating what we consider to be unhealthy.\nA lot of us will do well taking this stoic advice and just eating what we know is healthy, in amounts that allow us to live better. No more and no less.\nYep, that was me in 2010 \ud83d\ude42 Amazing what a little weight gain will do to your mindset. But I don\u2019t think anyone can understand any eating disorder until they experience it, so it\u2019s all too easy to brush off the appearance of obsession as self indulgence rather than understanding why people end up there.\nPrevious post: \u2026and I\u2019m back!", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T12:22:44Z", "url": "http://www.paleoz.com/philosophy/random-thought-more-stoic-paleoism/", "byte_size": 1886, "char_size": 1857}

{"text": "\u2022 Semikhah could only be conveyed by a quorum of three judges, one of whom must himself have Semikhah.5 Semikhah could be conferred verbally or in writing. The \u201claying on of hands\u201d was only practiced in the earlier generations. It was not practiced beyond the generation of Moses and Joshua.\n\u2022 Both the grantor and recipient must be in Israel at the time Semikhah is given. \u2022 In order to receive Semikhah, one must be an expert in all areas of Torah law. He must also be of proper character and zealously observant of the mitzvos and words of the sages.\n\u2022 Yoreh Yoreh (He shall instruct, he shall instruct) \u2013 This ordination was for matters of religious and ritual law.\n\u2022 Yadin Yadin (He shall judge, he shall judge) \u2013 This ordination qualified the scholar to matters of civil, criminal, and monetary law.\n\u2022 Yatir Yatir or Yatir Bechoros Yatir (He shall permit, he shall permit) \u2013 This ordination qualified its holder to rule on matters of animal sacrifices and ritual purity.\nBy the fourth and fifth centuries the Romans had driven most of the rabbinic community across the border into what is now Iraq. With few sages remaining in Israel, the chain of Semikhah eventually broke.8 For the next several centuries, the title \u201crabbi\u201d would not be used.9 Instead, a scholar would either be referred to as \u201ckhokham\u201d (wise one) or, if he held a position of authority, as a Gaon (eminence).\n4 Most of this material is taken from Maimonides, Hil. Sanhedrin 4.\n5 Sanhedrin 13b-14a. Hilchos Sanhedrin 4:5.\n8 There are some Gaonic traditions indicating that ordination may have continued beyond the fourth century. See the Kovetz Shaarei Tzedek, p. 29-30 and Sefer HaShtarot, p. 132. However, even these concur that there is no modern semikhah.\n9 The term \u201cRabbi\u201d is not all that common in the Talmud either. There are many honorifics used in the Talmud for Torah scholars. However, most of them are referred to simply by their names or sobriquets.\nIn modern times, Semikhah refers to a degree or diploma certifying one as having completed a course of study in halakhah, Jewish law. The impetus for this new Semikhah was the rise of the medieval university, which began to issue diplomas and degrees. Jewish communities, in constant flux, saw the value of credentialing its religious scholars. They called this academic degree Semikhah in commemoration of the classical Semikhah. While this Semikhah caught on in the European Jewish world, Sephardic communities did not adopt it until very late.\n\u2022 Rav U-Manhig \u2013 The equivalent of a Bachelor\u2019s degree, this Semikhah originated in the 20th century at Ner Israel Rabbinical College in Baltimore, MD. It certifies the holder as a teacher and as knowing the basic laws of the synagogue ritual service and observance of the holidays. Not all yeshivas issue this Semikhah or accept it as valid. Where accepted, the holder may use the title Rabbi.\n\u2022 Yoreh Yoreh \u2013 Equivalent of a Master\u2019s degree. Based on the classical Yoreh Yoreh, this is usually awarded following a course of study in kashrus (dietary laws), Shabbat, Niddah (laws pertaining to married women), and Aveilus (mourning). Traditionally, the final exam is given in Issur ve-heter (a very detailed sub-section of the dietary laws). This is the most common Semikhah today. A Rabbi with this Semikhah, who holds a position of communal authority, may be called Rav.\n\u2022 Yadin Yadin \u2013 Also based on the classical Semikhah, this ordination is the equivalent of a Ph.D. It requires extensive study of the laws of monetary and civil damages, as well as the laws of marriage and divorce. One who holds this ordination may be called Dayan. In the US, however, they are usually called Rabbi or Rav.\nThere is a fourth level that is very uncommon in our times called heter horaah (although this term is confusingly applied to other ordinations as well) or Semikhahs Moreh Horaah. This is an all-encompassing Semikhah awarded to rare scholars who have mastered the entire body of Torah literature. Very few people receive this today.\n\u2022 Semikhah is first and foremost a certification in Torah Law. Biblical interpretation, philosophy, and theology, are rarely, if ever, part of the curriculum. semikhah is only relevant to the study of Torah law \u2013 it is not awarded for knowledge of other areas.\n\u2022 Semikhah is an academic degree attained after a course of study and examination. It is not awarded based on righteousness or character. There are people with semikhah who are not particularly pleasant.\n\u2022 One who has semikhah at one level may not teach or answer questions about law from a higher level. Someone with Yoreh Yoreh should not answer questions about Yadin Yadin material.\n\u2022 Because it is possible to get semikhah in only one narrow area, it means that one does have to be a Torah scholar anymore to be a Rabbi. Likewise, one doesn\u2019t need to be a rabbi to be a Torah scholar.\n\u2022 One does not have to study at a yeshiva to attain semikhah. Either a person can study at a yeshiva and receive semikhah from the Yeshiva, or one can study privately and be examined by a renowned Torah scholar.\nUltimately, the world of Torah scholarship is a meritocracy \u2013 the greater scholars receive the greatest recognition and are accorded authority on the merits of their achievements. For this reason, many of the greatest Torah scholars and authorities of the past 150 years never bothered with semikhah.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T23:10:00Z", "url": "https://www.noahidenations.com/index.php/academy-of-shem/more-torah-wisdom/793-choosing-a-rabbi?showall=1&limitstart=", "byte_size": 5444, "char_size": 5378}

{"text": "Up until the middle of 2016, the past few years have been quite difficult for LTL carriers. As fuel prices and line haul rates dropped, as did business for the freight industry. As time\u2019s progressed, the recession has since ended and LTL carriers are again beginning to thrive. While this is great for those who heavily rely on LTL shipping, there\u2019s still plenty you need to consider as you seek a carrier and find the lowest possible rates for such. Plus, with the end of the recession, freight rates have increased, which can put more stress on you as the shipper.\nTo help reduce the stress of finding an LTL carrier, FreightorGator provides helpful tools and resources for shippers relying on LTL shipping. Having said that, we\u2019ve laid out a few key considerations for shipping LTL freight. From finding the lowest rates to better managing inventory, the considerations below can help simplify your shipping process.\nWith the aforementioned end to the freight recession, costs for shipping LTL has increased. While this presents more options within LTL carriers, price remains a major factor. However, cost isn\u2019t the only factor shippers need to consider when seeking a carrier. While we all want the lowest rates possible, there\u2019s other important pieces to consider that will ultimately simplify the process.\nDepending on where you\u2019re shipping your LTL freight, you\u2019ll want to consider regional and national carriers. If you\u2019re point of origin and destination aren\u2019t far, a regional carrier may be the better option, as freight rates tend to be lower. As you sift through prospective LTL carriers, pay attention to their geographic coverage and applicable services.\nWhile transit times are never guaranteed, there\u2019s always a general timeline to refer to. Similarly, regional carriers tend to provide quicker transit times for regional lanes, yet the services may be limited. While national or long-haul carriers will have higher costs, they may offer specific services that suit your needs.\nWhile virtually all carriers have liability insurance coverage, that\u2019s not to say their standard policy will completely cover any and all issues. Depending on the type of freight at hand and how it\u2019s stowed, you may need to add additional insurance to your freight, which will also cost more. This should be a major consideration as you compare prospective carriers.\nOf course, shipping prices are always the main concern in shipping LTL freight, as with any service. However, not only should you compare the freight rates for each potential carrier, but you should also pay mind to any additional fees and accessorial charges that may otherwise remain hidden until the deal is done. Pay close attention to detail as you assess the prices of each carrier and ensure there won\u2019t be any unexpected fees.\nDespite the freight recession starting back in 2014, around this same time, the consumer market began to thrive. In turn, many manufacturers and shippers increased inventory and expanded warehousing to keep up with such demands on consumer products. Not long after, however, this demand decreased and shippers were left with more inventory than they knew what to do with. Considering all this, inventory management is crucial to not only shipping, but shipping LTL freight specifically.\nSeeing as how LTL is necessary for many shippers, and the process therein can be difficult, managing inventory is essential. Whether it\u2019s avoiding tracking what you sell and to whom you sell it or creating a better system for processing orders, there\u2019s plenty you can do to keep your inventory dialed.\nIn addition to keeping these considerations in mind as you seek LTL carriers and manage inventory, you can use the tools provided by FreightorGator to further simplify the entire process. To get started, use our instant quote tool for LTL shipments so you can begin comparing costs and find the lowest possible rates.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T19:55:05Z", "url": "https://freightorgator.com/ltl-freight-guide/considerations-for-ltl-freight/", "byte_size": 3933, "char_size": 3903}

{"text": "So yesterday I had my first session of skin peeling with Dr Mohamed Gharib, a professional Dermatologist at Kaya Skin Clinic (Marina Branch). My consultation which was around a week ago, was so informative. Dr Gharib made me feel so comfortable about the whole procedure which is why I went ahead with his recommendation of skin peeling and mesotherapy. At the consultation he asked me what my concerns were regarding my skin to which I explained how due to having to wear make up so often because of my career, my skin sometimes breaks out with mild acne. I also told him how I\u2019m unhappy with the hollowness and darkness around my eye area. Even after having just one consultation, it was so invaluable. Dr Gharib made me understand what\u2019s going on with my skin and why. It all makes so much sense now, meaning I can do as much as I can within my control to help my skin improve. I don\u2019t want to bombard you with too much text so please follow my YouTube channel www.youtube.com/ninaubhi where I will be uploading the final journey of my experience of Skin Peeling and Mesotheraphy once I\u2019ve completed all four sessions. I\u2019ll also be posting on my blog after each session so I can really give you my full experience.\nSESSION ONE I\u2019ve been sick for the last few days and thankfully I felt well enough to go out yesterday afternoon. So luckily I made it for my first session of skin peeling and mesotherapy at the Kaya Skin Clinic. Firstly, the staff at Kaya Skin Clinic are so professional and they made the whole process so much easier and secondly they have a branch in Marina which is so close to me! Skin Peel: So I arrived with zero make up on and settled down in the treatment room. The nurse started by firstly explaining the process and then cleansing my face to remove any residue. Then comes the high frequency Accura machine that is glided across my skin manually by the nurse, continuously for around 10 minutes; this calms any inflammation and reduces the size of spots. She then started the skin detox by extracting any open comedones. Once the skin is cleansed, Dr Gharib applies the skin peel treatment over my face and it\u2019s left on for a few minutes. There\u2019s a slight tingling sensation but nothing too uncomfortable. The skin peel treatment is removed by spraying cold water onto the face and pressing it off with a thick towel/gauze followed by some ice over the skin to cool it down. After this my skin felt totally normal and after an hour or so a little tight. I\u2019ve been told my skin may feel dry and tight which it has but it\u2019s not peeling like you assume it would be by the sound of the name. Mesotherapy: The nurse applied numbing cream to my under eyes and eyelids. After leaving it on for 20 minutes Dr Gharib then removed the cream and started injecting vitamins into the skin around the eyes. It didn\u2019t hurt at all, thankfully due to the numbing cream.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a relaxing and soothing facial type experience then this isn\u2019t it. But it\u2019s also not uncomfortable. It\u2019s a treatment to help clear up your skin and I love the fact I already feel it working. It\u2019s only been a day and I\u2019m looking forward to my next session. Each session of the skin peel needs to be 15 days apart and the mesotherapy needs to be every week.\nTo book a consultation with Dr Gharib contact Kaya Skin Clinic on +971 4 4508438.\nMesotherapy is getting great results, it hurts a little in you don\u2019t use a proper anesthetic but no one can argue with the results.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T00:55:04Z", "url": "https://ninaubhi.com/skin-peel-mesotherapy-session-1-kaya-skin-clinic/", "byte_size": 3509, "char_size": 3473}

{"text": "What is the fifth wave?\nThe mid-January defeat in Congress of the Protect IP Act (PIPA) and its evil twin, the Stop Piracy Act (or SOPA), is a dramatic illustration of the decline of established authority in the face of a rebellious public. The authorities engaged in this particular farce were political and economic: a handful of senators and congressmen, and the organizational chieftains of the entertainment industry. The performance began with quiet murmurs behind drawn curtains, but ended with a pratfall-filled chase scene in the full light of day, worthy of the Marx Brothers.\nThe sponsoring politicians clearly believed this was a technical matter, to be settled among lawmakers and interested parties. It never occurred to them that anyone would be paying attention. For their part, representatives of the \u201ccreative\u201d establishment felt entitled to reduce the web to something like an occupied country, and co-opt the Justice Department to secure their profits. It never occurred to them to question the outsourcing of their business needs to the government.\nThis being Washington DC, the line between political and corporate power was fuzzy.\nAccording to Politico, Allison Halatei, former Deputy Chief of Staff to House Judiciary Chairman Lamar Smith, and Lauren Pastarnack, a Senate Judiciary Committee Senior Aide, just accepted jobs with two of the lobbying firms backing SOPA and PIPA. Halatei and Pastarnack helped write the bills. Halataei is now the National Music Publisher\u2019s Association chief liaison to Congress, and Pasternak is now the director of government relations for the MPAA.\nThe head of the MPAA is Chris Dodd, a former senator. By law, he is banned from lobbying Congress, but as sultan of the music publishers he can throw fistfuls of coins to his friends from a $100 million lobbying war chest.\nPIPA/SOPA enjoyed support from the Republicans who run the House and the Democrats who run the Senate. It was a rare bipartisan effort, mantled in the undivided power and prestige of the federal legislature. That it collapsed so quickly, and in such a comic opera atmosphere, should be considered a symptom of our strange moment in history.\nThe dispute over SOPA is often framed as pitting Washington-savvy Hollywood against the na\u00effs of Silicon Valley. This characterization is by no means false. I applied it in my previous post on the subject, and it pretty accurately describes the early phases of the conflict.\nBut something changed. As the knowledgeable Yochai Benkler observes, it wasn\u2019t Google or Facebook which orchestrated the bills\u2019 astonishing reversal of fortune. It was the eruption into the process \u2013 typically sudden and unforeseen \u2013 of the hordes of an aroused public.\nIt turned out many people had been paying attention after all. Marketing campaigns by tech companies helped call attention to the problems with SOPA, but this was largely an organic movement, an internet thing. I don\u2019t know much about the internet, but I know this: virality is unforeseeable. Marketing geniuses, deploying the sexiest technical applications, will fail to achieve it. Yet teenage kids reproducing images of kittens go viral in a trice.\nThe web is overwhelmingly populated by cute cat communities and their like. This is Ethan Zuckerman\u2019s insight, not mine. Building on the idea, Zuckerman has advanced a \u201ccute cat theory\u201d of web activism: if you mess with the governance of the internet, you will get into serious political trouble at the point when you truly and really piss off the cute cat users \u2013 the multitudinous, normally apolitical public. That, in brief, is what happened to Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, and to SOPA\u2019s sponsors in Congress.\nSome tech companies, in fact, seemed dazed by the ferocity of the public\u2019s reaction. Within a week of Godaddy\u2019s announced support for SOPA, a user boycott had moved over 70,000 domains out of the company\u2019s hosting site, forcing a clearly disoriented management to distance itself from the bill.\nThe effort to publicize the fight over PIPA/SOPA involved web activists like Rebecca MacKinnon and new media mavens like Jeff Jarvis, nonprofit entities like Wikipedia and multibillion-dollar outfits like Facebook. On 18 January, while Congress continued to ponder various versions of the two bills, Wikipedia, Reddit, and thousands of additional sites \u2013 including, let it be noted, the most popular cute cat location \u2013 went dark in protest. Other websites maintained service but made their displeasure known. Google, for example, conspicuously blacked out its logo.\nFirst, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a rising Republican star, took to Facebook, one of the vehicles for promoting opposition, to renounce a bill he had co-sponsored. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who leads the G.O.P.\u2019s Senate campaign efforts, used Facebook to urge his colleagues to slow the bill down. Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina and a Tea Party favorite, announced his opposition on Twitter, which was already boiling over with anti-#SOPA and #PIPA fever.\nThen trickle turned to flood \u2014 adding Senators Mark Kirk of Illinois and Roy Blunt of Missouri, and Representatives Lee Terry of Nebraska and Ben Quayle of Arizona. At least 10 senators and nearly twice that many House members announced their opposition.\n\u201cThanks for all the calls, e-mails, and tweets. I will be opposing #SOPA and #PIPA,\u201d Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, wrote in a Twitter message. Late Wednesday, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, withdrew his support for a bill he helped write.\nTwo days after the Wikipedia blackout, both PIPA and SOPA were withdrawn without ever coming up for a vote.\nThere are lessons from this struggle, for those with eyes to see. Political power sought control, rather than the imposition of any particular ideology. The web is mostly illegible to government. Those who have absorbed James C. Scott\u2019s Seeing Like a State know that modern governments everywhere seek to transform the social landscape to make it more legible from the center. On this account, SOPA won\u2019t be the last attempt to impose a policing regime on the web.\nPolitical and business actors argued from authority, rather than the merits of the case. They suffered from tunnel vision, willfully ignoring the unintended consequences of patrolling the public\u2019s means of communication on the web. Political players believed they worked within a club of friends. The entertainment industry looked at its business interests and saw a moral imperative. Neither expected opposition from outside their charmed circle, so neither could muster persuasive arguments when, to their complete surprise, that opposition materialized.\nEstablished authority was blind to the information environment in which the public works and plays. It could not see where the revolt against SOPA came from. Authority emanates from hierarchical structures which once monopolized access to information and communication. Everything produced outside these structures appears worse than illegitimate: unreal. Dodd thus blamed his industry\u2019s legislative disaster on \u201cInternet companies\u201d and their \u201cability to spread their message globally, without regulation or fact-checking.\u201d He never saw the public that trounced him.\nFinally, the nature of the conflict between authority and the public is what the Pentagon would call asymmetric: one is powerful and slow-moving, the other numerous and quicksilver. Principles of action diverge accordingly, with authority worshipping rank and orderly process, while the public, as public, displays informality and a contrarian streak sometimes verging on nihilism. With SOPA, authority tried to make the web more like itself. Disruptive change, I suspect, will soon flow in the opposite direction.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T06:05:10Z", "url": "https://thefifthwave.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/lessons-of-sopa/", "byte_size": 7862, "char_size": 7801}

Well today i was definitely finding a hard time to roll onto my stomach and slide off my top bunk to the bottom mattress and slip onto the floor. . but I FINALLY managed. I kept on the shorts i slept in and threw on a sports bra and white t-shirt. After my first class i have an hour break, which i WAS going to go running during, cuz that's what us athletes do (plus i'm getting fat) . . but my eyes were SO tired, we agreed to nap before public speaking at 10!!! Well Breanne knocked on my door to go to class and immediately started her durogatory commentary on my outfit.\nI understand that i don't ALWAYS believe in matching my clothes. I don't always want to look impressive or adorable. . because A. I looke that way in sweats w/o trying. and B. i don't care what people thinK!!!! . . but APpaRentLY my half yellow half pink Volcom striped board shorts, with my still white basketball shirt and my white and silver champion flip flops were just too much. . So we walk into the building where public speaking is and breanne points out her dismay at my outfit to some of our teammates, softball girls and hawaiins. lol . . they seemed confused, but not as haterade-ish as breanne. .\nSo after class i have to go meet with my counselor to see if SVU is accredited school. . lol i wait for like 15 minutes, (course i got there 10 minutes early) so this hawaiin lady named Gina walks out and calls my name. I stand up and look at her and she goes, \"did you just wake up?\" . . lol ah geez, EVERYBODY has got jokes today! lol . . i go \"Nope, i been up since 8!\". . . she's quick to recover you barely see her face flinch and she recovers with same lame comment about, \"oh, that's so great you have that look of being well rested.\" . . Ha, yeah thanks lady!\nNow I'm curious what Hunter would have said to you because he was a little embarrassed when we just walked into lowes because I have shorts and a t-shirt on that have paint on them... his comment \"mom you sure you don't need to change first!\"..

{"text": "I wish I could say that we did all this super interesting stuff the last 10 days\u2026but I would be fibbing if I said that. Truth is we really haven\u2019t done much at all. Connie\u2019s been working her full 20 hour per week maximum for the past 4 o 5 weeks trying to get all of her students placed. She\u2019s dealing with a total of 3 classes getting scheduled right now and finally has enough spots for all of them but they\u2019re being very slow in getting all of their paperwork requirements completed so that they can go out on clinical.\nBeyond that we had Valentines Day dinner out\u2026we went to a place named the Elephant Bar and Grill. This is a chain with about 20 or so locations across the country and we thought it was pretty decent back when we were in our early 30\u2019s in San Diego\u2026but our tastes have changed and the decor, service from the wait staff, and overall vibe just didn\u2019t do it for us. The food was pretty good but overall it was pretty much a bust.\nConnie won twice at Bingo in the past week as well. Neil got some new hardware and rehung our sign out front\u2026the original brass plated cup hooks he used rusted away so he replaced them with a pair of stainless screw eyes. We also bought some new solar powered walk lights about a foot high\u2026got six of these to put around our patio and light up our entrance approach a little.\nThe main data storage drive in our file server died\u2026luckily no data was lost as Neil has lots of backups. It was a 1.5 TB drive and he bought a pair of 3 TB drives to replace it and it\u2019s mirror backup with. He thought he was being smart and just got bare drives with the intention of putting them into the existing cases since bare drives are 80 bucks cheaper each. Got the new drives and discovered that the old cases won\u2019t support a 3 TB drive\u2026so he got an RMA and shipped them back and ordered two new drives with cases. They\u2019ll be here Tuesday or so and we\u2019ll have our IT systems back up to full capability. He also bought a small fan to put up in our overhead storage area (over the fridge) where the drives live to give a little more air flow across them and help keep them cool.\nThursday we decided to head out on a kayak trip; after some discussion we elected to head over to the Jn Ding Darling NWR over on Sanibel Island about 30 miles from Seminole. While the kayaking was pretty decent\u2026the traffic was horrible. When we got over to the entrance to the toll plaza for the causeway over to the island (6 bucks to get over, gotta be rich to live over there I guess) there was a 30 minute backup and then we limped along taking another 30 minutes to get the 2.5 miles out to the NWR parking lot. Had a nice kayak paddle through Tarpon Bay and some of the mangrove marsh areas and headed back only to find out the traffic was even worse. Took an hour to get off the island and then another hour to get home since it was rush hour by that time and we had to deal with commuter traffic. We won\u2019t go over there again, there\u2019s another paddling place a lot closer and easier to get to.\nHad dinner at the Elks last night\u2026fish fry night all you can eat for 9 bucks. That and a coupla pitchers of beer (Amber Boch\u2026not great but it\u2019s the darkest brew they have) made a pretty outstanding dinner. Neil took out some lamb chops that he\u2019ll grill tomorrow and then we\u2019ll have leftovers for Monday night since there are 8 in the package.\nSorry, I didn\u2019t get any pictures on the kayak trip\u2026we lost our waterproof camera and have to buy a new one (or else a waterproof iPhone case) for ourselves.\nStarted working on our post Sevierville travel plans today; we had already figured out from Mar 15 when we leave through the beginning of May and today Connie figured out the plan through mid June when we arrive at Camp Horizons in Junction City. While the rig is getting some work done on it we\u2019re headed off for vacation for 3 weeks. We\u2019re almost completed figuring out what it will be\u2026will post details as soon as they\u2019re finalized.\nYUM!!

{"text": "Adam Zuvanich Sep. 19, 2017 Updated: Sep. 19, 2017 6:02 p.m.\nBurbank's Isaac Cantu, Marcus Bolden and Tristin Zamora, along with Memorial's Anthony Esparza and Xavier Banks, discuss last week's wins to start District 28-5A play.\nFootball is therapeutic for many of the players at Memorial, including its senior quarterback.\nAnthony Esparza said both of his parents have battled drug addiction, leading him to battle depression and forcing him to fend for himself at times. He works in the kitchen at a local pizza chain on Saturdays and Sundays, the only two days of the week he does not spend at school and with the Minutemen.\nEsparza described time with his teammates as a \u201cgetaway,\u201d moments he can be distracted from his home life and have fun. But football had been hard to enjoy for Memorial, which took a 21-game losing streak into Friday\u2019s District 28-5A opener against Jefferson.\nThe Minutemen stopped that skid with a 23-17, triple-overtime win at Edgewood Veterans Stadium. It was their first win since Esparza\u2019s first varsity game as a sophomore in 2015 and also ended a 30-game losing streak in district play that began in 2013.\nThe players at Burbank, a San Antonio ISD school about eight miles away from Memorial, can relate. The Bulldogs\u2019 only win during the past two seasons came against the Minutemen, and they also started this season with two losses.\nJust like Memorial, Burbank broke through with a district-opening win no one saw coming except for the players and coaches on its sideline. Even some of them were surprised by the 35-32 win against Highlands, last year\u2019s district co-champion and the only 28-5A team to start this year with two wins.\nIt could be a wild race in 28-5A, since the two teams that finished at the bottom of the district standings last year are tied for first place after the first round of league games. At the very least, Friday\u2019s triumphs provided hope at schools where hope can be hard to come by.\nGiving up is an ever-present threat at Burbank, where head coach Mark Perez said only about half of the players who enter the program as freshmen stick with the Bulldogs through their senior year. Some stop playing because they have to work to help support their families. Some do not want to work during practice and the offseason.\nCantu quit the team for the final two games of last season, even though he was a team captain. He said he is glad to be back with the Bulldogs, who were upbeat and focused at Monday\u2019s practice.\nMemorial coach Kemmie Lewis said learning how to win has been one of the chief challenges for his players, who were not sure how to react after beating Jefferson. He said the campus and community long have been resigned to losing.\nLike Esparza, many of the Minutemen cope with off-the-field issues. Lewis says he has \u201ckids that are semi-homeless, kids that barely have a meal besides meals at school, kids that are fathers.\u201d So the coach has gradually tried to build up his players by aiming for small daily victories such as making it to school on time or lining up correctly at practice.\nNow that the Minutemen have experienced a larger win, a Friday night game with playoff implications, they yearn for more. Because while football is an escape, winning makes it even more worthwhile.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T00:40:14Z", "url": "https://www.expressnews.com/sports/columnists/adam_zuvanich/article/Long-suffering-Burbank-Memorial-relish-in-12209564.php", "byte_size": 3283, "char_size": 3263}

He has, however, left his Wellesley mansion, where he has lived since joining the team in 2007, all 11,093 square feet of it: nine bedrooms, nine and a half bathrooms, four stories on 1.44 acres, a wood-paneled library, a media room that seats 12 comfortably, a six-car garage, parking for as many as 10 vehicles, and a grand foyer. Get out your checkbook kids, this place is all yours for $5.2 million. So, does having an amazing house and celebrity status mean you can opt out of staging? We say no.....and here is why.\nWe have toured several homes of this size and overwhelming is the word that comes to mind. The echos caused bare hardwood and empty rooms do not help make a house like this feel cozy. Many buyers struggle to think how they would decorate a seemingly unending number of very large rooms. How do you make a house this size feel like home? Sure it is fun at first but then it just becomes a challenge. We have had clients with homes of this size that lived with empty rooms because they simply could not figure out how to make them work.....and that is how staging sells a property - we show you how this could be your home.\nThis exterior is impressive. So no pressure to make the interior equally as impressive - right?\nThis is a lovely room, very large. We are assuming it is a bedroom. How would you decorate a room of this size?\nThis room is nothing short of spectacular. We love the paneling and the bookshelves.

{"text": "I\u2019ve been a Strange Chemistry fan from the beginning. Its editor, Amanda Rutter, was one of the first friends I made when I discovered the blogosphere, at the time she was still blogging at Floor to Ceiling Books, and she helped me out a lot when I decided to start blogging myself. So to see her move into publishing herself was exciting and witnessing Strange Chemistry publish some of the most innovative and wonderful books in the field of YA in the past two years has been a pleasure.\nWhen this morning the news broke that both Strange Chemistry and Angry Robot\u2019s crime imprint Exhibit A Books were the cease operations immediately, followed some time later by the news that Osprey is looking to sell Angry Robot, I was shocked, to say the least. My first thoughts were for the wonderful authors published by both these imprints, some of whom I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to meet in person, and for Amanda, Caroline, Lee, Mike and Marc, who do such excellent work bringing us these books. My second thoughts were that now I\u2019d not find out how the stories I\u2019d been waiting for to continue would end. Well at least not in the near-future.\nOf course there are all sorts of ramifications to this news, not in the least what will happen to those titles that were contracted but now won\u2019t be published and for those authors who were in the midst of a series. And as you\u2019d expect reactions have already been starting to appear online. I\u2019ve tried to collect them below and I\u2019ll keep them updated for the next few days. Meanwhile I\u2019ll be keeping my fingers crossed that everyone impacted by these closures will quickly and squarely land on their feet and find new publishing homes.\nThere is no reason why an author with a series unfinished cannot self publish the rest of the series.

{"text": "Canadian research ethics: Caught in a quagmire of privacy legislation?\nThis article, from the National Post (September 24) revisits, again, the cry from researchers that overzealous privacy legislation, at both federal and provincial levels, are preventing researchers from accessing individuals and databases. This quick overview of an article originally in the Canadian Journal of Public Health (July- August 2008, A. Harris et al) illuminates two important points that researchers and REBs continue to agonize over.\nFirst, privacy legislation is making it difficult, if not impossible to access data that previously was available to researchers, even anonymized data stripped of all possible identifiers.\nSecond, and most importantly, the privacy legislation is difficult for many to understand and therefore, is applied and interpreted very differently by different agencies, data stewards and, I would add, REBs and researchers, who are obligated to understand the legislation as applied to specific situations, agencies, information across a variety of contexts.\nTrue enough, the legislation is more than difficult for even smart people to interpret. The \u201cbasic reader\u201d on Canadian privacy laws published by the Canadian government that I keep on my desk is thick and heavy with enough very small print to make it a daunting task to try to find an answer to the simplest question. It makes a great paperweight but is not overly helpful in my own interpretation and application of the Acts.\nAccording to the Canadian government, Canada has the most comprehensive privacy legislation in the world. Few would argue with that. At a federal level, there is PIPEDA and the Privacy Act. In addition, provinces and territories have their own privacy legislation statutes, and even the most educated persons are not always quite sure whether federal legislation trumps provincial or vice versa, on an ad hoc basis.\nOntario, interestingly enough, has both PHIPA (The Personal Health Information Protection Act) and FIPPA (The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act). PHIPA allows for the protection of the privacy of persons and the confidentiality of their personal health information. FIPPA is designed in part to protect individuals\u2019 identifiable information held by institutions, guide institutions on how to handle information and allow individuals access to the information that an institution holds about them.\nMost REBs in Ontario are involved with applying both PHIPA and FIPPA when reviewing researchers\u2019 plans on accessing personal data and health information. Most researchers have to work within the constraints of FIPPA and/or PHIPA to access individuals and information. But it is a laborious task for all concerned. And many people aren\u2019t even sure which act is which if they aren\u2019t engaged with privacy issues on a daily basis.\nI was also amused to find that while everyone refers to FIPPA phonetically, some also pronounce the acronym for the Personal Health Information Act (PHIPA) exactly the same, correctly pronouncing the \u201cph\u201d as a \u201cf\u201d. Yet more confusion, no doubt, probably quite unknowingly, in many conversations\u2026.\nWhile there are certainly clear distinctions between the Privacy Act, PIPEDA, PHIPA, FIPPA and other provincial statutes, it remains that the legislation created with the laudable aim of protecting Canadian citizens is unclear, the separate Acts can be difficult for both lay persons and academics to untangle and many institutions and agencies are either not applying the Acts at all, or interpreting and thereby applying them in an incorrect way. The valuable objectives and good intentions of protecting private information and those most vulnerable to a breach in privacy are obscured against a backdrop of confusion and a lack of guidance and clarity by governing bodies.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T14:43:00Z", "url": "https://researchethicsblog.com/2008/10/07/canadian-research-ethics-caught-in-a-quagmire-of-privacy-legislation/", "byte_size": 3850, "char_size": 3828}

{"text": "So Foley banks are not lending as freely these days huh? The credit crunch that seized the Alabama economy recently is gone and they are starting to lend again. But even with this lending the economy is still reeling and headed for even more dire straits. If you are one of those in Foley AL who is caught in its clutches and have debts piling up, you may want to think about Foley consolidation loans.\nWho has the best Foley debt consolidation services?\nFoley consolidation services offer a way of taking multiple debts and taking them all and wrapping them together into one payment. So if you have 5 different Foley loans, each with a different interest rate and length, a Foley debt consolidation loan will pay these off and then you will be left with one Foley loan with a total on the loan of all the paid off loans. The best part is that these types of Foley consolidation loans typically have lower interest rates than the ones you are getting rid of.\nWhat is the best place in Alabama to find Foley credit consolidation lenders?\nSearch online for the best debt consolidation lenders in Foley AL. The reason the best place to find Foley debt consolidation lenders in Alabama is because you will be able to find the right Foley lender for you. Your local Foley banks may not specialize in the right Foley consolidation loans for you or have Alabama lending standards that are too stringent. By searching for the best Alabama debt consolidation loans online, you can assure yourself of getting the right Foley loan.\nAs I said above, prior to the credit crunch we had basically \"easy money\" whereby the Foley banks were encouraged to lend to pretty much anyone in Alabama with a pulse. As the economy tanked and their Foley debts mounted, a large portion of these people who got easy credit are now looking for Foley credit card consolidation programs. These Foley loans can be obtained but they are just like any other Foley loan. Your Alabama credit rating, your ability to repay the Foley loan, an availability of collateral to secure the loan and the current Foley bank policies on Alabama lending will determine if you get a Foley consolidation loan or not.\nWhere Is The Best Foley Loan Consolidation Service?\nAs I discussed above, the typical Foley loan consolidation service usually has a lower interest rate than the standard Alabama loan that is putting you in the poor house. Be aware that just because you are in trouble with your Foley monthly payments, does not mean that you will automatically get Foley loan consolidation.\nWhere Can I find The Best Foley Debt Consolidation Help?\nI spoke of collateral before and this is a big aspect of why Foley debt consolidation lenders may give you Foley loan consolidation. Unsecured Foley loans are the riskiest loans to give by a Alabama lender. This is because if the Foley loan is defaulted on, the bank cannot get the money back. By requiring collateral to provide security on a loan (as some Foley banks do for Foley debt consolidation loans) the bank reduces their risk for the loan. A secured Foley loan allows the lender to offer the loan to you and then to offer the Foley loan at a reduced interest rate. Be careful to make sure you pay off the Foley credit card consolidation loan on time. If you were required to put up collateral and you default, the Foley bank will take that collateral as a way to recoup their loss.\nAt MyCDC.org, we offer the highest quality Foley credit card consolidation programs that are available online throughout the USA. Mycdc offers this online by providing you with a custom Foley credit card consolidation plan that will help you to consolidate your unsecured debts, and also fit your budget, while helping you to reach your goal of Financial FREEDOM!\nFoley Consolidation Loans -- Our online credit card consolidation service will consolidate debt without the need of a loan.

{"text": "Quartz is one of the most common and varied minerals on earth, and its abundant colors produce many gemstone types. Amethyst and Citrine are the most popular and valuable gem varieties of Quartz, but other forms also make important gemstones. Chalcedony describes any form of Quartz that is microcrystalline, in compact form without any visible crystals. Chalcedony also has several varieties used as gemstones, most notably Agate, Carnelian, Tiger's Eye, and Chrysoprase.\nPure Quartz, which is also known as Rock Crystal, is colorless. Various impurities are responsible for the extensive range of colors. The main crystalline Quartz varieties used as gemstones are described below.\nAmethyst, the purple variety, is the most popular and valuable Quartz gemstone. Amethyst ranges from light to dark purple. See the Amethyst gemstone page for more details.\nCitrine is the yellow, orange, or reddish-brown variety of Quartz. It is usually colored by heat treatment of Amethyst or Smoky Quartz. Light yellow or lemon yellow Citrine is often called Lemon Quartz in the gem trade. See the Citrine gemstone page for more details.\nSmoky Quartz is the brown \"smoky\" variety of Quartz. It ranges in color from light brown to black. Despite its dark color, it is rarely opaque. See the Smoky Quartz gemstone page for more details.\nThe rosy pink variety of Quartz is known as Rose Quartz, and its color is usually soft, ranging from very light pink to medium pink in intensity. Rose Quartz is often milky or hazy, and it may lack good transparency. See the Rose Quartz gemstone page for more details.\nThe colorless, transparent variety of Quartz, free of any impurities, is known as \"Rock Crystal\". Flawless and very large cuts may be cut from Rock Crystal.\nMilky Quartz is the white, translucent to opaque variety of Quartz. Though very common in nature, it is not used as a gemstone.\nColorless Quartz with golden yellow Rutile inclusions, as hairlike growths within the gemstone, are known as Rutilated Quartz. See the Rutilated Quartz gemstone page for more details.\nAmetrine is an interesting, color-zoned combination of purple Amethyst and brownish-yellow Citrine. See the Ametrine gemstone page for more details.\nPrasiolite, or Green Quartz, describes a light green Quartz artificially colored by heat treatment of certain types of Amethyst. May also be called \"Green Amethyst\" by some jewelers.\nThe blue variety of Quartz, which is uncommon in nature, is seldom used as a gemstone. Most \"Blue Quartz\" is clear Rock Crystal irradiated with gold to from a deep sky blue color. Blue Quartz may also refer to a dull grayish-blue Quartz in massive form with Crocidolite inclusions.\nColorless Quartz with Tourmaline inclusions, often as thin long black crystals, is known as \"Tourmalinated Quartz\".\nCat's Eye Quartz is Quartz with dense, tiny Rutile inclusions that cause a cat's eye effect. It is not common, and the chatoyant effect is usually weak. Cat's Eye Quartz is usually grayish in color and translucent.\nAll forms of Quartz are used as gemstones, and they are all affordable. They are cut into various gemstone cuts and cabochons, and used in all forms of jewelry. Lesser quality stones are often tumbled for use in bracelets, necklaces, and as costume jewelery. Large spheres and carvings are also cut from all the Quartz forms. Due to its abundance and lack of luster, Rock Crystal is not commonly cut into gemstones, although some very large spheres and sculptures are carved from it. Small crystals of Rock Crystal are sometime worn as pendants, sometimes being polished and smoothed, and sometimes in their entirely natural crystal form.\nVarieties specific to Amethyst, Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Rose Quartz, Rutilated Quartz, and Chalcedony are listed separately.\nAmethyst\t- Purple variety of Quartz, and its most popular and valuable gemstone variety. (See the Amethyst gemstone page for more details.) Tumbled Amethyst with white Milky Quartz is sometimes known as Amethyst Quartz.\nAventurine\t- Opaque, compact Quartz / Chalcedony containing small Mica, Hematite, or Goethite scales which cause a glistening effect. Aventurine is most often green but may also be other colors such as gray, orange, and brown.\nBlue Quartz - Rare natural blue variety of Quartz. It is caused by inclusions of blue minerals, especially Dumortierite. Most \"Blue Quartz\" is what is popularly known as \"Aqua Aura\", essentially clear Rock Crystal synthetically irradiated with gold to form a deep sky blue color. Blue Quartz may also refer to a dull grayish-blue Quartz in massive form with Crocidolite inclusions.\nCat's Eye Quartz - Quartz with dense, tiny Rutile inclusions that cause a cat's eye effect. Cat's Eye Quartz is not common, and the chatoyant effect is usually weak. Cat's Eye Quartz is usually grayish in color and translucent.\nLemon Quartz - Lemon Quartz is a light to dark yellow Citrine, distinguished from most Citrine by lacking orange, brown, or reddish tints. More often though it is clear Quartz that is irradiated to produce an intensely colored yellow gemstone. Lemon Quartz has recently experienced a popularity increase in the gemstone market.\nMilky Quartz - White, translucent to opaque variety of Quartz. It is not commonly used as a gemstone.\nPrase - Light to emerald green, transparent to translucent Quartz / Chalcedony, with coloring caused from inclusions of green minerals, such as Actinolite, Hedenbergite, Chlorite, or Malachite.\nPrasiolite - Light green gem form Quartz artificially colored by heat treatment of certain types of Amethyst. May also be called Green Amethyst by some jewelers.\nRock Crystal - The colorless, transparent variety of Quartz, free of impurities is called \"Rock Crystal\".\nTourmalinated Quartz - Quartz with splintery Tourmaline inclusions.\nAmethyst may be heat treated to deepen the purple color. Most gem Citrine is produced by heat treating Amethyst, and the green Quartz known as Prasiolite or \"Green Amethyst\" is also produced by heating Amethyst from specific localities.\nCertain colorful Quartz types not found in nature are produced through irradiation. Some forms of Quartz with a multicolored rainbow effect are synthetically treated to produce their color effect using film deposition. The process involves bonding an extremely thin metallic film layer over the top of the gemstone, so that the interesting color effects are reflected from the crown. Some vividly colorful forms of Quartz are synthetic grown using the hydrothermal method.\nQuartz is extremely common and is found in numerous localities throughout the world. The important sources are far too numerous to mention, though in general the most prolific countries that produce Quartz gemstones are Brazil, Madagascar, India, and the U.S. (Arkansas). Specific sources for the popular Quartz varieties are described on their dedicated pages.\nSee the individual variety pages for specific variety similarities.\nRock crystal is similar to glass, but the softness of glass usually lends it to scratches and soft etches which are lacking on Rock Crystal. Rock Crystal is rarely cut into small facets, so it usually is not a concern of confusion to other colorless gems such as Diamond, White Topaz, and White Sapphire. These white gemstones will also have a greater dispersion and exhibit more fire.\nAdditional images for the varieties Amethyst, Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Rose Quartz, Rutilated Quartz, and Chalcedony are listed separately.\nHave a question about Quartz?

Fashioned from Italian top-grain leather for a sophisticated look, this wallet is fashionable and professional.\nDimensions 4.25 in. x 6.63 in.\nI looked long and hard to find a replacement for my old, worn out leather wallet. I wanted one with may pockets for credit cards, IDs, etc, with pockets for bills and notes under the card area. I almost gave up the search, as it appeared no one makes them in this style, when I stumbled across this model at Overstock. It fits my need beautifully, with more than enough card slots. I keep my wallet in my front pocket, so its size is just right for me. It is Italian leather, and very nicely constructed. I expect it to last quite a long time.\nThis wallet had excellent quality, the leather was top notch. Plenty of room for ALL of your credit cards (or coupons, store cards, etc.). Overstock.com shipped super fast. Very pleased with this purchase.\nI have always loved my old wallet given as a Christmas gift 30 years ago. It was the best, held a good number of credit cards, a place for my license,and for cash. I thought I would never find another like it. But I saw the Columbo Long Credit Card Wallet on Overstock and thought why not give it a try. It is fantastic. High quality leather, holds 21 cards and has a place for cash. I had read that the License holder was hard to extract a License from so I put mine in a Credit Card slot and the problem is solved. I am now happier with this new wallet than with my old reliable. Great Product.\nI just received this fine wallet. It's very simple, and plain, and yet it looks very expensive and elegant (real leather), at least the cognac color I ordered. I have a very expensive wallet, but I cannot carry all my cards at once. With this one absolutely no problem at all. I have more than twenty, plus two large pockets for bill/receipts. The price is very low in comparison with other ones. I like the size, you can fit it nicely in any normal pants or shirts pockets. Go for it!!\nI've been looking for a credit card that would accommodate 18+ credit cards. After unsuccessfully searching for the wallet at countless stores, I decided to check out overstock.com. The Colombo Long Credit Card is just perfect! I would highly recommend this product! It is strong, clean, and neat.\nI looked long and hard to find a replacement for my old, worn out leather wallet. I wanted one with may pockets for credit cards, IDs, etc, with pockets for bills and notes under the card area. I almost gave up the search, as it appeared no one makes them in this style, when I stumbled across this model at Amazon. It fits my need beautifully, with more than enough card slots. I keep my wallet in my front pocket, so its size is just right for me. It is Italian leather, and very nicely constructed. I expect it to last quite a long time.\nPurchased this Christmas for my husband, who had always carried a basic leather wallet. His ATM card literally broke off on the top portion, \"twice\" in the last year, due to the fact that his cards were all bunched in his traditional wallet. I've just asked him what he liked most about this wallet, he says \"the fact that it was so thin now\", compared to the \"thickness\" of the regular types he'd carried in the past. I'm sure now it has to be more comfortable to carry, not to mention to sit on, now that it is no longer 3\" thick! It's just a very nice wallet. And a special \"Thank You\" to Overstock for the price!\nRecently purchased this item since I seem to carry a lot of cards but I also carry lots of bills like one's, five's, ten's, twenties, and so on. So I also needed a capable bill holder and I saw this one had two bill holders. I was pleasantly surprised as to how it absorbed all cards and how neat and low key it closes. As for the bill compartments they were tight which I attributed to the new leather and still waiting if it will be easier to carry currency like on a oversized bi-fold, which is what I was using before. The bi-fold seemed to handle the bills with more composure but the Colombo Long Credit Card Wallet, as its name so implies, is the clear winner for carrying cards without a hassle. If the leather cedes and my bills gain ground I will be most satisfied for I killed two birds with one shot, sort of speak. I like it enough to rate it 4 stars and if it loosens up, well, the sky is the limit. Either way did not think once about returning this item and it is easy to carry around because of its low profile.\nUntil the day comes when one rfid coupled with biometrics can consolidate all my plastic into one card, something like this is a necessity. This does the job I need it to do in handsome fashion.\nMy wife bought this wallet for me as a birthday gift and I absolutely love it. At first I only used it for business travel but now use it every day. Great craftsmanship and design. I can now keep my work related cards& ID's separated from my personal cards. It took some getting used to pulling my wallet out of my inside suit jacket pocket and don't see myself ever going back to carrying a wallet in my rear pants pocket. ( A money clip does just fine on the weekends!) Plenty of space for cash, receipts, id's, credit and rewards cards. Best of all, this wallet is not bulky and fits nicely in to the inside pocket of a suit coat or blazer.\nI had been searching for a wallet like this for over six months. Every store I would go into and nothing. I went on line to many websites and nothing. I went into my email and like always I had a email from Overstock.com and I started looking on web page and there it was. I ordered this wallet and when I got it I was very pleased with the price, quality and that it had 20 slots that would now hold all my charge cards. Finally I had what I wanted and it only took five minutes on Overstock and over six moths looking elsewhere. This wallet is top of the line and you will love it. Great shipping as always. Thanks to Overstock.com for bringing us nice items at a low price.\nFor people who have a lot of credit cards and want easy access to them at a glance, this is a excellent solution. This is not a \"back pocket\" wallet - too large and flat for that. The quality of the leather is better than I expected for the price. The slots are a snug fit for the cards, but will ease with use. All in all, I'm very satisfied.\nwell made but quite large for fitting in a pants pocket.\nI love this wallet. I have had it for a year and still looks brand new. Holds several cards and is RFID. I surely recommend this wallet. Well worth the money!\nIt was nothing like it was shown in the picture not worth the money.\nExactly what I wanted. It arrived sooner than I expected, and is well made. It should last a long time. Would recommend it to anyone who needs large card case.\nGreat! Comfortable and silky feeling! It fits my king great!\nIt\u2019s not as big as I thought, which, is a good thing. The quality is great, I just have to use it more, meaning; taking cards in and out to break in that process. Being new, it\u2019s a bit tight.\nExactly what I was looking for. Has held up well.\n\"I need assurance that the black wallet is like the cognac. The photo for the black color does not look anything like the wallet I'm looking for.\"\nThey are the same, just different colors.\n\"The name of the Wallet is the Colombo RFID credit card wallet yet in the descriptions nowhere does it entail about the RFID features. Does it really have that security feature?\"\nInside the wallet it is stamped RFID secure. It is a very nice wallet. As of today I haven't had a problem yet security wise.\n\"I am wondering about the color. When the cognac wallet is pictured by itself it has a darker color. When it is pictured beside the black wallet it is much lighter and looks more orangy. I am wondering which color is more accurate.\"\nI have several purchased over the years, both black and cognac. My take is that the cognac is true to its name, but some might associate the color with light brown? Very nice, though, I would wait for a nice sale to purchase.\n\"Yes, it did come in a box. It's a Beautiful Walett, and would in courage you to make the purchase.\"\n\"Is it come with box? \"\nYes, it came packaged in a box that was worthy of gift giving.\nYes, it comes in a box. Gave away as a gift in the box/ package that it came in.\n\"Is there room for a checkbook and register?\"\nHello kellyjs, this wallet is designed mostly for credit cards only. It will likely be too small for a checkbook and register. Please let us know if you have additional questions. Thanks for shopping with us.\n\"When will the black be in stock again?\"\nHello Richard.Kissick, items are restocked as they become available; however, we cannot guarantee an item will be restocked.

Your message is important. Create it once and keep it consistent. Branding, marketing and content can be the same quality for your total reach without compromising time or quality. Your website will appear in different search engines, to a different audience who will be typing in different search terms to find products and services that you offer.\nSALES.

If your website is translated into many languages, it will have an increased flow of traffic.

{"text": "Canadian-born, Berlin-based artist Jeremy Shaw joins us to present and discuss the UK premiere of his recently completed Quantification Trilogy, which imagines countercultural behaviours at three different points in the future.\nThe first film in the trilogy, Quickeners (2014), is set 500 years in the future and tells the story of Human Atavism Syndrome (HAS), an obscure disorder afflicting a tiny portion of the existing immortal species wirelessly interconnected through a central hive. HAS causes those affected to desire and feel as their human being predecessors once did: giving sermons, singing, praying, dancing, speaking in tongues, performing rituals with snakes and trying to reach ecstatic states.\nLiminals (2017), the second film in the trilogy, is set three generations from today and unfolds as chapter cut from a future documentary about marginalised societies. With the discovery that the long-abandoned notion of faith had biologically evolved to become an essential aspect of human survival, a radical clandestine group augment their brains with machine DNA and re-engage forgotten cathartic spiritual rituals in the hopes of accessing The Liminal \u2013 a speculative paraspace between the physical and the virtual. It is here they prophesise that humanity will temporarily exist in gestation towards a new phase of evolution.\nThe final film, I Can See Forever (2018), is set roughly 40 years in the future and is structured as a documentary TV episode about the only known survivor of a failed government experiment that aimed to create a harmonious synthesis of human and machine. Born with 8.7% machine DNA, yet uninterested in the virtual reality trappings of his time, the 27-year old survivor has committed himself to a life immersed in dance. It is during his unique virtuosic activities that he claims to be able to transcend to a digital plane of total unity while maintaining a corporeal physical presence.\nJeremy Shaw (b.1977, Canada) is a visual artist based in Berlin. His work explores altered states and the cultural and scientific practices that aspire to map transcendental experience. Often combining and amplifying strategies of verit\u00e9 filmmaking, conceptual art, music video, esoteric and scientific research, he creates a post-documentary space in which disparate belief-systems and histories are thrown into an interpretive limbo. Shaw participated in the 57th Venice Biennale (2017) and is the recipient of the 2016 Sobey Art Award. Solo exhibitions include Kunstverein in Hamburg (2018), Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (2018), The Store x The Vinyl Factory, London (2017), Schinkel Pavillon, Berlin (2013), MoMA PS1, New York (2011), and Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art, Toronto (2006).", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T07:07:18Z", "url": "https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/film/jeremy-shaw-quantification-trilogy?utm_source=emarsys&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=CRM_Sep_w1_film&sc_src=email_483373&sc_customer=2117351&sc_lid=41197186&sc_uid=qRBpidAiRI&sc_llid=8185&sc_eh=07df62df8488aace1", "byte_size": 2732, "char_size": 2729}

{"text": "Figolli are Maltese traditional sweets eaten in the Easter period. Since everyone asked for a healthy version on facebook, here is my alternative and guilt free figolli version. This recipe is gluten free, grain free and paleo.\nFigolli are usually made of a sweet almond paste filling between a sweet pie crust. They are then covered with icing or chocolate. I used ground almonds for the pie crust instead of the conventional flour and sugar. I decided to use homemade apple sauce as a major ingredient in the filling and adding only a little more almonds in the filling. The result has a different and softer texture but it is very tasty and with a similar flavor to the well known figolli. Anyone who doesn\u2019t like figolli because they are dry will love this recipe!\nIt is best to store these figolli inside refregirator. Enjoy and Happy Easter!\nStart by making the apple sauce following instructions found here. Let cool.\nTo make pastry blend all dry ingredient together in the food processor.\nLightly whisk the pastry wet ingredients together and then mix into the dry ingredients until dough is formed.\nCover dough with cling film and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nIn the meantime prepare almond filling. Mix all ingredients together and simmer for about 12 minutes until thickened.\nTake out the dough from fridge and divide into two parts. Take one part and place it between two baking sheets. Flatten with rolling pin. The sheets will prevent the dough from sticking to the rolling pin or work surface.\nCut out shapes by using an Easter cookie cutter. Remember that you need two cutouts for one figolla.\nUse a flat spatula to transfer the pastry shape onto a lined baking tray.\nDistribute some of the filling onto each shape leaving a 1cm margin from the edge.\nWork out the second batch of shapes and using a flat spatula to transfer the cutouts over the filled bottoms pressing the edge together to seal well.\nBake for 15-20 minutes until the top turns light golden brown.\nRemove from the oven and let cool in tray for 5/10 minutes until they are cool enough to handle. Then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. (Don\u2019t leave them to cool in the baking tray as they will become soggy from the condensation formed).\nTo decorate, melt chocolate in a double broiler, cover figolli with chocolate and sprinkle over some chopped pistachio nuts or coconut.\nCover finished figolli with cling film and store in the refrigerator.

I kept asking myself how she could suffer so many setbacks yet keep coming back for more \u2013 either crazy or stubborn or both, but either way she tells quite a tale. Fiona\u2019s ability to pull herself up time again speaks to the spirit so commonly seen in people with Multiple Sclerosis. The compassion and understanding of her support network reminds us that for every bad disease there are even good people ready to help fight it.\n\u201cFiona\u2019s Fight is an inspiring breath of fresh air. A strong reminder to us all that you should never give up, no matter what life throws at you or how hopeless everything may seem. Fiona\u2019s heartfelt story will resonate in some way with anyone who reads it.\nIf you have been disappointed, let down, made a poor judgmental decision or if you have ever had those you though we closest to you suddenly turn their backs on you when you have needed them most, you need to read this book.\nWorking for the MS Society of Canada, and living with Multiple Sclerosis myself I can honestly say that in so many ways this story resonates beyond words. Experiencing Multiple Sclerosis from numerous perspectives I am here to tell you there is one common thread between Fiona\u2019s Fight and every single other personal fight we all experience throughout our lifetimes. That common thread is HOPE, the one thing we all cling to when we are at what seems to be our worst, our \u201cRock Bottom\u201d.\nFiona\u2019s Fight reminds me every day that although it will never be fast enough, The MS Society of Canada and MS researchers across Canada are enhancing the quality of life for everyone affected by MS while making incredible progress in treating and one day finally Ending Multiple Sclerosis.\nFiona\u2019s Fight is an honest look at the challenges faced by an amazing woman. The book shares the incredible story of Fiona and the numerous challenges she faced in her life. It is not only an inspirational story of Fiona surviving a rare form of MS and the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant needed to save her life but also a book that shares with us her humor, honesty and courage in the face of numerous calamities. Fiona\u2019s Fight is the story of a survivor. It is not only inspirational because of all challenges that Fiona has faced but also because of how she honestly shares with us her private struggles, and humanity. Reading this book, you cannot help but root for Fiona and have a greater insight into recovery from alcoholism and from serious illness. This is an important book because as Fiona herself puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s important to have someone who can empathize and relate to you on a personal level\u201d. This book carries a message of identification and hope for those who have shared in Fiona\u2019s struggles and is a reminder that we are never alone.\nThis was a book I could not put down. As a fighter of my own Autoimmune Disease, CIDP, which is much like MS, I felt bonded to Fiona and her fight. This is real life in the raw. I too have had HSCT to halt my own disease and was right there beside her while reading this book. Events are true and miraculous. This book gives you the insight on what really happens while affected by an autoimmune disease and the misery they cause. HSCT is not for everyone, but this book gives you the inspiration to want to find out more about it to halt the disease that kills so many people. This book is very inspiring, motivating and heartfelt. GO FIONA.\nI received this book yesterday and couldn\u2019t put it down. Fiona has written the story of her fight with herself and her battles with MS with an amazing clarity. After having read this book I feel like I\u2019ve gotten to know an amazing person. I would recommend this book especially to anyone fighting the disease of MS but also to anyone searching for clarity in their life.\nFiona\u2019s Fight is an amazing book about one woman\u2019s life and struggle with not only addiction but a very rare and deadly form of MS (multiple sclerosis). It was impossible to put down and I would highly recommend it to anyone, but especially to those who are affected by or have someone close who is affected by a serious disease.\nThis is an awesome book. Feels like you are sitting with her having coffee and she is telling you the story. Loved it!!!!!! She is an amazing person and is surrounded by exceptional people!\nEnthralling true story of Fiona\u2019s life.\nNot many face similar challenges,struggles,cumulative obstacles,that in her case could well have taken her life or changed the sparkle and fight in her..\nShe\u2019s lived more life in her years,than many lived in their lifetimes.\nShe had many experiences,some that could well shatter others for the remainder of their lives.\nI enjoyed her describe the work she did in a field many considered a man\u2019s job.\nI loved that she did it with gusto,challenges at times,sheer will,joy,and pride.\nAs she relays the onset of her medical condition,it\u2019s symptoms that can take down the best of us,she kept picking herself up through the most trying of times.\nWhile Fiona could be close to my daughter\u2019s age,I saw her as a friend in this struggle with multiple sclerosis and life\u2019s inherent obstacles and triumphs.\nHer medical condition escalated to a grave variant of multiple sclerosis that few live to tell about.\nI couldn\u2019t put the book down,I was captivated.\nThis is a story of triumph and perseverance and the power of something greater,with the essence of humanity,humility and the power of forgiveness and great will in the mix.\nSuch Grace,I was humbled by her strength,and all those who made a difference in keeping her alive.\nThis story needed to be told,and shared,it was such a pleasure to read.\nInspiring,and that is an understatement.\nTruly a must read for anyone,it is also a coming of age story as she tells about her teens,the heartbreak of betrayal and shame and working her way through to finding herself again.\nDelightful read,so glad I purchased this,it\u2019s become one of the treasures I have in my collection.\nSo inspirational, Fiona what a wonderful writer you are!!

{"text": "There are the obvious options for wedding venues: Churches, hotels, community centers, private resorts. Some of those options are expensive and some of them aren\u2019t.\nHowever, if your wedding has a lead time longer than just a week or two, you might be overlooking a few more interesting options.\nAnd let\u2019s be clear right up front: the point of this piece isn\u2019t to save money, necessarily, but you may find that many of these options are more affordable than a 10k booking at a downtown resort simply because they haven\u2019t been commercialized in the way that traditional wedding venues have.\nImagine a pristine morning on the water.\nMaybe it\u2019s a bit brisk, but the waves are crashing gently on the shoreline. The sun is up, but the air is still cool and the breeze from the coast keeps the bugs well away from everyone and everything.\nGrowing up on the coast, I\u2019ve seen this one personally. Beach wedding venues are a great way to give everyone in your wedding party (no matter how large) a breath of fresh air and a gathering to remember.\nWhile you might need to check with the local municipality to see if there are any restrictions, beaches are, by and large, free and open to the public.\nIf you close off a space or you need to rent out a few pavilions or whatnot, you might be charged for that \u2014 but you\u2019ll likely be looking at something relatively affordable, as weddings go.\nOne of most straightforward tricks for better photography is to find a photogenic subject. Placing a wedding in a beautiful location is a great way to end up with beautiful wedding shots.\nHere in the city, everyone wants to get away. Many of my clients rent a cottage (if they don\u2019t have own one anyway) at least once or twice a year.\nWhy not have a wedding out there? As far as wedding venues go, you\u2019ll have privacy and a wide selection to choose from, especially if you\u2019re planning advance. Particularly if you have a family cottage, you\u2019d find yourself surrounded by ancestral heritage.\nCottages are usually secluded and well away from the city, so expect a drive if you go this route. However, if saying your vows in a secluded place and surrounded by loved ones feels better to you than a church or a hotel ballroom, it can be a much better way to connect with friends and family who want to be part of your special day.\nAvid hikers and morning walkers will relate to this one. There\u2019s just something about the serenity and pristine stillness of the woods that gives the area and atmosphere of quiet anticipation.\nA wedding party in the woods requires a bit of planning, but as far as wedding venues go, it\u2019s a great pick!\nOf course, a wedding at the height of fall is all about the colour change, and that\u2019s a love story that practically writes itself. Remember what I said earlier about wedding venues in photogenic places?\nCheck around your local area. Go for a drive or walk the hiking trails nearby. You typically don\u2019t have to venture very far into the woods to find an ideal spot for a quiet getaway.\nThough historic sites are often equipped for weddings, they\u2019re often forgotten in the search for ideal wedding venues.\nOld grist mills, barns, even covered bridges and log cabins are all possible contenders for an alternative venue, particularly if you prefer a rustic style.\nIf you see something you like while you\u2019re walking around the city or driving down the highway, don\u2019t be afraid to ask about it.\nThe worst answer you can get is \u201cno\u201d, and you\u2019ll have a host of other options anyway.\nThis is my personal favourite. When searching for the perfect venue, try to find something that matches the season.\nThat corn maze you visited last year or the pumpkin patch right down the road might be great fits for wedding venues with a fall or harvest flavour. Sunflower and wheat fields are wonderfully scenic during midsummer. And, of course, winter weddings are beautiful even if it\u2019s a little chilly.\nAs a photographer, I see the inside of churches quite a bit. And don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 most of them are really beautiful. The wedding business has no shortage of wedding venues when it comes to churches, hotels, and similar commercial getaways.\nAll I\u2019m saying here is that, whatever your budget, you might find your wedding even more memorable if you treat your search for the perfect location like a treasure hunt.\nFind something that aligns with your personality and style. Unique venues like the ones above also gives a photographer like me the chance to deliver a host of images with a different look and feel than your standard chapel service.\nI mentioned at the top of this piece that this article wasn\u2019t about saving money. And that\u2019s true; it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about making memories that last. The place you choose to say your vows will mean even more if the place you select is something special.\nThat\u2019s something that a lot of couples overlook.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T22:52:14Z", "url": "https://www.luminaphotographic.com/client-resources/5-alternative-and-affordable-wedding-venues/", "byte_size": 4902, "char_size": 4840}

{"text": "In early 2002, researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Institute (MBARI) were using the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Tiburon to investigate deep-sea clams off Monterey Canyon. While there, they came across the skeleton of a whale that had apparently been picked clean by what seemed to be a carpet of tiny, worm-like creatures. They were growing like crazy, said MBARI biologist Robert Vrijenhoek in a news release about the discovery, carpeting the remaining whale bones. The worms had short trunks topped by red plumes, and were about an inch or two in height.\u201d When researchers had a chance to examine the creatures more closely, some weren\u2019t convinced they were even worms. All did agree they were very strange, but very few probably could have imagined just how strange they\u2019d turn out to be.\nDNA analysis confirmed these creatures were indeed annelids, related to other species of tubeworms that live around hydrothermal vents. Like the vent worms, the whale worms had bright red plumes that acted as gills, collecting oxygen from seawater. Unlike the vent worms, however, these worms had green, root-like structures that penetrated the whale bones and branched out in the marrow cavity. These roots, in fact, turned out to be the most important part of the worms body, containing specialized bacteria allowing for the breakdown of the oils and proteins in the bones.\nBut things began to get strange when researchers couldn\u2019t seem to find any males among the specimens brought up to the surface. Things went from strange to utterly bizarre when they discovered that males did exist, but that, in this species of worms, the males never passed the larval stage. They instead lived in groups of 30 to 100 inside a females body. In short, males dont feed like the females do but instead live off the yolk of the egg that produced them, all the while producing sperm for the further propagation of the species. Why such an odd method for keeping the species going? Dr. Vrijenhoek suggests the worms are like the ecological equivalent of dandelions\u2013a weedy species that grows rapidly, makes lots of eggs, and disperses far and wide.\u201d The strategy makes sense when you consider what depending upon dead whales as a source of food would entail. Once the worms had picked the whale clean, they\u2019d run out food. Releasing as many tiny larvae as they could and having the ocean current carry them away would increase the chances of them landing on another whale carcass.\nOver the next three years, MBARI scientists sank whale carcasses from depths of 400 to 1,800 meters and discovered as many as 12 species of these strange, bone-eating worms living just in Monterey Bay alone. Later, additional species were found off the coasts of Sweden and Japan. The scientists gave the worms the name Osedax, which is Latin for bone-eating. They found that different species of the worms appeared at various depths and attacked the whale carcass at different stages of decomposition.\nIn less than a decade, this previously unknown species of worm has gone from anonymity to something of a cultural phenomenon, inspiring things such as childrens\u2019 hand puppets and the name of a rock band. Regardless of their roles, it seemed that these worms had one thing in common: they fed on mammals. Such a strict diet, however, would have implications for when the Osedax could have developed. If only able to feast on mammalian bones, the Osedax could not have have evolved during the Cretaceous period, well before the dawn of marine mammals, as many seemed to believe. To solve the puzzle, researchers from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California-San Diego decided to set some bait for the worms. Again using ROVs, the scientists sunk tuna and Wahoo bones, as well as shark cartilage, to a depth of 1,000 meters off Monterey Canyon. Collecting the bones five months later, they found three distinct species of Osedax growing on them. (The shark cartilage apparently fell prey to other organisms.) This experiment proved that the Osedax werent whale bone specialists but bone-eating generalists.\nThe Scripps and MBARI researchers plan to continue their studies of the nutritional limits of the Osedax, in particular concentrating on how they might be able to use shark cartilage. The researchers are also interested in coming to a better understanding of exactly how the Osedax feed off the bone. If past findings are any indication of what to expect, undoubtedly they will find many new species of these strange ocean-dwelling worms.\nWhale-eating worms? What next? Shark-devouring bacteria?

The America Saves Pledge and other research, tools, and resources have helped thousands of Savers set and achieve their savings goals.\nLillian Karabaic, Oh My Dollar!\nHow can games be used to change student financial habits?We'll discuss a variety of gamification concepts that keep students regularly engaged with financial literacy programs and makes them excited about the mundane. What if you could get students to eagerly track their spending or open a savings account? We'll interactively design a game in this session after hearing examples, showing that games don't need to be complicated (or techy).", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T07:37:21Z", "url": "https://www.hefwa.org/monday-session-3", "byte_size": 2294, "char_size": 2294}
{"text": "New research from the University of Illinois in Chicago suggests that fetal exposure to a commonly used chemical which is found in products such as water bottles, soup can liners and paper receipts, can increase the risk of prostate cancer later in life.\nExposure of the fetus to the chemical BPA in utero has been linked to several kinds of cancer, including prostate cancer, in rodent models in the past. The new findings show that human prostate tissue could also be susceptible.\n\"The safety of BPA has long been a contentious topic of debate and this is not the first time that it has been linked to some types of cancer. However, research in this area is fraught with difficulties because it relies solely on testing the impact of the chemical in cell or animal models. It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions as to what might happen in real-life and as such we cannot make a definitive link between BPA exposure and prostate cancer in later life based on the results of this study.\nThis study highlights that much more needs to be done to identify the lifestyle and environmental factors that put men more at risk of prostate cancer so that we can start to reduce the number of deaths from the disease.\"", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T22:03:47Z", "url": "https://prostatecanceruk.org/about-us/news-and-views/2014/1/commonly-used-chemical-might-increase-risk-of-cancer-in-human-prostate-tissue", "byte_size": 1215, "char_size": 1215}

{"text": "Fashion designers and clothing experts are wandering how a new suit might change their industry. The suit is a little out of this world - literally. It is a spacesuit that has its own built-in toilet. The high-tech garb has been designed by NASA engineers to help astronauts deal with the call of nature in emergency situations in space. The new suits are called the Orion Crew Survival Systems Suits (OCSSS). They will be worn by astronauts on NASA's next-generation spacecraft, Orion, which will venture a lot farther away from Earth than previous space missions have gone. The spacecraft will not be advanced enough to reach Mars, but will be able to carry humans around the moon and back.\nThe OCSSS spacesuits will allow astronauts to survive for six days in emergency situations. The suit is fitted with a revolutionary waste disposal system that will allow astronauts to do things like urinate and defecate without taking it off. Astronauts will also be able to eat in the suit. NASA astronaut Rick Mastracchio explained how important and how much of a life-saver the OCSSS space suit will be. He said: \"Spaceflight is not always glamorous. People need to go the bathroom, even in a spacecraft. How is this waste treated such that it does not harm the astronaut or even kill them?\" The suit's technology could be used in hospitals and in the camping and trekking industries in the future.\n1.
