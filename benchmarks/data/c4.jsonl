{"text": "Sam Gold joins The Athletic after working his way through the journalist farm system and is enjoying life in the big league. Growing up outside of Washington, D.C., Sam didn\u2019t choose the Redskins, the Redskins chose him. Out of a love for the game and an insatiable curiosity to determine why his beloved team was underperforming, he turned to studying film.\nSeahawks Film Room: How important is bringing back free-agent guards Fluker, Sweezy?\nAmari Cooper is a complete receiver, and his acquisition has significantly upgraded the Dallas offense.\nAfter getting carved up by San Francisco's tight ends a week earlier, the Seahawks limited Travis Kelce to 54 yards on nine targets. Here's how they did it.\nJabrill Peppers is the ultimate hybrid defender in the modern NFL.\nA week after Seattle shut down the Vikings, 49ers tight ends terrorized the Seahawks. Ahead of a prime-time matchup with the Chiefs, Seattle should consider switching up its defense.\nSeahawks Film Room: What happened to Russell Wilson and the passing game Monday night?\nAfter a month of the most efficient football of his career, Russell Wilson finished Monday night's win over the Minnesota Vikings with 72 passing yards. Here's what went wrong.\nSeahawks Film Room: Why has Shaquill Griffin disappointed in Year 2?\nThe Seahawks' second-year corner is clearly talented, but developing consistent technique and habits will define his growth going into next season.\nSteelers Film Room: Why has James Conner been able to replicate Le'Veon Bell's production?\nJames Conner has a different running style than Le'Veon Bell. But he's been just as effective this season.\nThe Seahawks have trusted David Moore to play a big role in his second NFL season, and he's rewarding that trust with breakout performances.\nSeahawks Film Room: Why did pass rush dominate versus Packers?\nThe Seahawks doubled their average sack output in Thursday night's win over Green Bay. Was the success scheme-related, or did an individual player stand out?\nRashaad Penny finally flashed the play-making abilities that made him a first-round pick.\nIn this video breakdown, I tracked and analyzed each of his 74 carries so far on the year.\nRussell Wilson missed big opportunities, took unnecessary sacks and threw a pick-six, but somehow kept the Seahawks close versus the Chargers.\nRussell Wilson's statistically perfect effort versus the Lions didn't start out that way.\nFrank Clark is off to a great start in 2018, and the Seahawks need to re-sign him before he hits free agency.\nWhile many saw him as a top tier slot cornerback, there were some doubts on whether or not he could play outside.\nLast week versus the Raiders, the Seahawks scored their first opening-drive touchdown in 34 games. Credit offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's play-calling for the breakthrough.\nIn his first start, Tedric Thompson did a good job recognizing route combinations and calling out multiple plays before the snap, putting the Seahawks defense in position to succeed.\nJosh Rosen made his first NFL start on Sunday when the Cardinals hosted the Seahawks, and while nothing jumps off the page statistically, his numbers are misleading.\nIn Week 3, Chris Carson gained almost half of his 102 rushing yards independent of his offensive line's contribution. With Carson injured, Mike Davis more than matched that feat in Week 4.\nChristian McCaffrey is a runner, receiver and as a pass blocker in Carolina's offense, employing his elusiveness, patience, and vision to make plays.\nChris Carson was the first Seahawks running back to notch a 100-yard game in nearly two years. He's making the most of his opportunities and proving he deserves to be Seattle's lead back.\nBaker Mayfield consistently took advantage of the defensive matchups in exactly the ways Tyrod Taylor couldn't versus the Jets.\nPatrick Mahomes was considered by some to be the biggest boom-or-bust prospect in the 2017 draft, but his development is already proving his doubters wrong.\nRussell Wilson was responsible for half of the six sacks he took in Week 1 versus the Broncos. How many were his fault Monday night in Chicago?\nLooking for someone to blame for Seattle's poor performance on third down versus Denver? Start with the Seahawks' franchise quarterback.\nRookie tight end Will Dissly was a bright spot in Seattle's Week 1 loss at Denver, proving he can be a factor in the Seahawks' passing game in addition to his blocking duties.\nJulio Jones is such an incredibly talented route runner that he'll continue to perform well regardless who calls the plays.\nNew Seahawks quarterback Brett Hundley exhibits many of the same issues he had coming out of college despite three years in Green Bay.\nIn his sophomore season, Allen's budding talent will open eyes around the league.\nThe former Florida State star flashed the potential that convinced the Chargers to take him with the 17th overall pick.\nIn an ideal world, Seahawks rookie linebacker Shaquem Griffin could sit behind K.J. Wright for his entire first NFL season, but the fifth-round pick will be called upon to star sooner than later.\nBrian Schottenheimer has preached a \"back to basics\" message for Russell Wilson since being hired as offensive coordinator. In Seattle's the third preseason game, this focus on fundamentals paid off.\nUndrafted rookie Poona Ford is making the most of his limited opportunities. While he\u2019s mainly lining up against backup offensive lineman, he has shown enough upside to warrant a roster spot.\nAnalyzing the route combination he used against the Steelers' Cover 1 defense and how he used his strength and length to grab the score.\nThe Seahawks selected Rasheem Green to boost their pass rush after losing veterans Cliff Avril and Michael Bennett in the offseason. So far, the rookie has shown a lot of promise.\nThe forgotten man in Seattle's tight-end group this offseason, Nick Vannett flashed a lot of potential in the Seahawks\u2019 first preseason game.\nSaquon Barkley paired vision and patience to exploit the Browns' defense in his first NFL carry.\nJ.R. Sweezy played in only 14 games over the past two seasons in Tampa Bay, but his pass-blocking skills could earn him a starting job in his return to Seattle, provided he stays healthy.\nThe stats from Lamar Jackson's NFL debut weren't pretty, but he made some quality plays that should give Ravens fans hope for the future.\nDespite consistent production, Doug Baldwin is still one of the most underrated receivers in the NFL. That could change this year.\nSeahawks Film Room: Is McDougald better at free safety or strong safety?\nBradley McDougald displayed his versatility while filling in at both starting safety spots for the Seahawks last season, but which position is a better fit for his skills?\nUnder new offensive line coach Mike Solari, Seattle seems likely to feature more plays using down blocks, combination blocks and pulling offensive lineman, like \"60/70 Power.\"\nSeahawks Film Room: Is it time to re-sign Tyler Lockett?\nTyler Lockett is an elite return specialist, but he's still developing as a receiver. That presents the Seahawks with an interesting conundrum as he enters the final year of his rookie contract.\nKam Chancellor, who announced he was walking away from football after suffering a career-ending neck injury last year, impacted games in subtle and not-so-subtle ways for the Seahawks.\nThere weren't a lot of positives coming out of the Seahawks 2017 run game, but Chris Carson showed enough \u2013 in an admittedly small sample size \u2013 to compete for a starting job in 2018.\nKeenan Allen exceed all expectations in 2017 after returning from at torn ACL. Sam Gold breaks down how Allen used his superior route running and hip flexibility to create separation.\nDoes offensive line contribution affect running back contribution? Samuel Gold hopes to answer that question in the second part his of analysis on running back and offensive line performance.\nMost metrics do a relatively poor job of separating offensive line and running back performance on run plays. When comparing two of this year's first-round backs, Samuel Gold attempts to do just that.\nIt\u2019s clear Brandon Marshall isn\u2019t the same player he used to be, but the six-time Pro Bowler can play a valuable role in the Seahawks\u2019 offense.\nFourth-round tight end Will Dissly will be an instant upgrade for the Seahawks\u2019 offense and exemplifies Pete Carroll's \"always compete\" mentality.\nIn his first piece for The Athletic, Sam Gold breaks down third-round defensive end Rasheem Green's college film and tells us why he believes Green can be an impact player for the Seahawks.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T06:32:36Z", "url": "https://theathletic.com/author/sam-gold/", "byte_size": 8617, "char_size": 8599}
{"text": "I have the \u201cif you give a mouse a cookie\u201d mentality.\nThis is true with almost everything I do. Recently, I got a new Delta H2Okinetic\u00ae showerhead. When I installed this \u2013 I was in awe of how pretty it was. Bright and shiny! Like a new diamond.\nThen there was the ugly shower caddy that had years worth of gross soap scum all over it. You give me a new showerhead, and I\u2019m going to want a new shiny shower caddy to match. When you give me a new shower caddy \u2013 I\u2019m going to want a new shower curtain. When you give me a new shower curtain, I\u2019m going to want a new bath mat. Well, you get the picture\u2026\u2026.\u201dif you give a mouse a cookie\u201d mentality.\n1. Upgrade your shower head! ASAP.\nGet rid of that crusty old shower head that barely spits out enough water to wet your eyebrow! I\u2019m obsessed with my new Delta H2Okinetic\u00ae showerhead! This baby has multiple settings and the showerhead itself, is HUGE! Makes you feel like you\u2019re showering in a rain forest. Ahhhhhhhhhh.\nI love it because I can change it to whatever setting I\u2019m in the mood for. My husband always changes it to something different, so when I get in the shower it\u2019s like a box of chocolate candy\u2026.you never know what you\u2019re gonna get! HA!\nThe Delta H2Okinetic\u00ae showerhead is 2 showers in 1! A showerhead and hand shower that can operate seperately, or both at the same time.\nIt has 3x the coverage of a standard showerhead. Larger droplets and a unique wave pattern that creates the feeling of more pressure and a warmer shower experience. The showerhead also stays put! When you pull the hand showerhead out and place it back, it\u2019s kept firmly in place with a powerful magnet.\nAnother favorite feature that I love is the \u201cpause\u201d feature! You just push a small button that pauses the water flow so that you can lather up, shampoo your hair, or shave! I LOVE that!!!\nOnce you put in your new showerhead, your old shower caddy will just look SO out of place! Do yourself a favor and get a new caddy. Pick one that\u2019s large enough to hold your shampoo, conditioner, body washes, and razors!\nI don\u2019t know about you, but our shower curtains get GROSS. Really fast. Especially at the bottom of the curtain. New shower curtains are cheap \u2013 so grab a new one that matches your bathroom design and style!\nI love our microfiber bathmat! They\u2019re really soft and spongy \u2013 and they absorb a lot of water! If you have slick bathroom floors, a bathmat is a MUST anyway, especially if you have kids! Get one that adds a pop of color to your bathroom!\nTo top off the best shower experience ever \u2013 go buy a new body wash and shampoo. I love trying new scents! While you\u2019re at it, grab some body scrubs too!

It\u2019s an upgrade from frozen fish sticks that the kids love! Nothing wrong with those, we\u2019ll just leave those to the kiddos while we indulge in the big people stuff!\nThe new Michael Angelo\u2019s Salmon Piccata is CRAZY good! It\u2019s turned off chilly here this week and I really enjoyed warming up and having this for dinner. Perfection! Made with wild-caught Alaskan salmon, spring vegetables, and a fluffy brown rice in a piccata sauce. It\u2019s super flavorful, and the portion was perfect for me!\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Michael Angelo\u2019s foods for a long time now, and most people love the amazing flavor. What they don\u2019t know is that the ingredients are simple, and clean.\nWant a night off from having to cook?\nWant a super quick and easy seafood night at home?\nGrab some Michael Angelo\u2019s Seafood Meals, straight from the frozen aisle at your local grocery store.

If so, which was your fave or which would you love to try?\nLet\u2019s face it. Potatoes are an integral part of dinnertime. Especially at our house. My husband is one of those \u201cmeat and potatoes\u201d kinda guys.\nThere\u2019s just one thing though. This momma don\u2019t have the time, NOR the energy to stand and peel potatoes, cut potatoes, boil potatoes, and then mash the heck out of them to get all the lumps out. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do love me some mashed potatoes \u2013 but the real deal around our house isn\u2019t as often as I\u2019d like.\nI\u2019ve always been a huge fan of Idahoan because they are the best tasting \u201cinstant\u201d out there, in my opinion. Well, they have overwhelmingly upped their game!!!\nThe new Idahoan Signature Russets Mashed Potatoes are SO STINKING GOOOOOOOOOOOD! You\u2019d swear to the heavens above, that these were 100% completely homemade at your grandma-ma\u2019s house! Not even kidding!\nThey have a very smooth taste, just like original homemade mashed potatoes with just a hint of butter and cream.\nI made these the other night with one of my super quick and easy chicken recipes. We\u2019re having some remodeling done on the house, and this particular night \u2014 by the time dinner time came \u2013 I was too tired and needed something hearty for dinner! This was a HIT.\nPlace chicken breasts in a plastic container or large zip lock bag with Italian dressing. Shake around until chicken is well coated. Stick in fridge to marinate for 30 minutes or so.\nPlace chicken in baking dish or pan, pour leftover dressing from the baggie over top. Bake at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until no longer pink.\nSpoon some of the hot dressing from the pan over chicken.\nServe with mashed potatoes and your favorite veggies!\nThey\u2019re delicious. Oh, wait\u2026did I already say that?!\nMakes any meal taste like Sunday dinner!\nMore than 6 pounds of premium Idahoan russet potatoes go into every 16 oz. pouch.\nThey use a new processing method that let\u2019s the potatoes keep their natural goodness and texture. In the end, they taste as good as if you had peeled, boiled, and mashed them yourself!\nTakes just 5 minutes using milk and butter\u2026.or just water!\nYou can get them in a 4 serving, 12 serving, or 20 serving pouch \u2013 and the pouches are resealable.\nYou can find them nationwide, including Walmart and Kroger NOW!\nWhat\u2019s your go-to recipes with mashed potatoes as a side dish?\nThis post brought to you by Wearsafe.

They think they already know everything, right?! Yeah, they\u2019re pretty smart \u2013 but they\u2019re probably also still really naive. My niece, Hannah \u2013 my \u201cmini me\u201d \u2013 has just started her first year.\nBathroom selfies and all\u2026 (God love her heart!). I love her to pieces.\nCollege kids HAVE to be equipped with some \u201csmarts\u201d when it comes to their safety since we\u2019re not there to protect them. Here are 7 college safety tips for girls (and guys) that most of them won\u2019t ever think of\u2026until we tell them!\n1 . Have car/dorm keys handy BEFORE you get to the car or your dorm room. Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re there before you start digging around for keys.\n2 . Keep pepper spray handy. Most people think about having pepper spray on them, but most of the time they never even buy any.\n3 . Use your car alarm! If a stranger is following you in the parking lot \u2013 press that alarm button on your key ring. More than likely, they\u2019ll run the opposite direction!\n4 . Don\u2019t leave your drinks/food unattended. I know this one has been said over and over and over again \u2013 but for realz! Keep an eye on your drinks. You never know what weird creeper will drop something in it!\n5 . Never go to the ATM machine alone, especially at night. Make your bestie or room mate tag along with you. If she/he complains, offer them $5 or something off the dollar menu at Taco Bell. Guarantee they\u2019ll take you up on that!\n6 . Keep your expensive stuff like laptops and electronic devices hidden away in your backpack or bag when heading out to the car or to the library.\n7 . Use Wearsafe! It\u2019s a teeny tiny Tag that keeps the kids and their family/friends one step ahead of an unsafe situation. In this event \u2013 it can be hard to get help when you\u2019re fumbling around for your phone. I just set one up, and it was so easy to do!\nThis super small Wearsafe Tag uses your phone to alert your friends and family \u2013 by sending them audio from the scene.

Leave us a comment below or follow us on social media!\nSince the new year \u2013 I\u2019ve tried to get a little more fit and eat better. The biggest problem is my snacking habits, especially during the late mornings/early afternoon. Breaking that habit isn\u2019t easy, so I need this little orange zest drink to help curb my appetite.\nI found out about Meta Appetite Control \u2013 and wanted to give it a shot. It\u2019s a fiber supplement that reduces your appetite for up to 4 hours. That\u2019s exactly what I need to get me through that snacky slump in the middle of the day!\nBest part is that you can enter to receive a digital $5 off coupon and product sample for yourself to try out! Woohoo! You\u2019ll find out how, towards the end of the post.\nYou just add a couple heaping teaspoons of Meta Appetite Control into some ice cold water, and stir. I like to add ice to mine too, the colder \u2013 the better! I really like the Orange Zest flavor \u2013 but then again, I\u2019m a sucker for anything orange!\nYou could also add a couple spoonfuls into your morning or afternoon smoothies \u2013 to help keep you fuller, longer too!\nIt\u2019s the #1 recommended fiber brand by doctors. It\u2019s made with 100% natural psyllium fiber*!\nIt\u2019s been clinically proven to keep you full between meals, and reduce your hunger.

What do you think?!\nThis is a sponsored post for SheSpeaks/Bounty, however all opinions and spaghetti sauce splatters are my own.\nI\u2019ve really been trying hard this past week to watch what I\u2019m eating. I decided to give myself one day on the weekends as my \u201ccheat\u201d day and enjoy something that I love. We decided on spaghetti and meatballs. No argument from the family, either. We all love spaghetti.\nThese homemade Italian meatballs were sooooo good and really simple to make. I\u2019m going to share the recipe with you. Just prepare spaghetti the way you normally do to pair with these yummy meatballs.\nOkay, on to the recipe. You\u2019ll also find a printable recipe down near the bottom of this post. Just print it off and stick back in your recipe box!\n*About halfway through cooking, turn meatballs in the tins to brown the other side.\n** To brown the meatballs really well, turn on the broiler for the last couple of minutes. Watch carefully so you don\u2019t burn them.\nWe recently remodeled and updated our kitchen. I wanted a white farmhouse kitchen, and that\u2019s what I got. However, the beadboard backsplash around the counter and the panel behind the stove is white and shows ALL kinds of splatters. Spaghetti making the worst messes, naturally. The sauce is yummy, but it\u2019s also messy. When it bubbles, it pops and splatters everywhere. Do you have the same issue?\nI also opted for all white dish towels and dish cloths. I just love the way they look in a kitchen. So fresh and crisp. I never even thought how EVERY thing that you clean up stains those pretty white towels and cloths and they get really dingy really fast.\nBounty recently came out with a BRAND new kind of paper towel. It\u2019s Bounty with Dawn, ya\u2019ll. With Dawn. They\u2019re thicker than your average paper towel and you just activate them with water. Then they get all nice and sudsy! I am in LOVE with these. You can rinse and wring these puppies out so you can clean up the whole mess with ONE paper towel instead of 10!\nDawn is awesome at fighting grease so that combined with the thickness of these new Bounty with Dawn paper towels is a double-whammy! The towels were good at breaking up dried on food too. I had the oven on, baking the meatballs and the sauce and spaghetti on the stovetop. The heat from the stove made the sauce dry up and after dinner, the new Bounty with Dawn paper towel wiped it up in just a couple of swipes. I was VERY impressed!\nMake sure to check out the new Bounty with Dawn paper towels the next time you\u2019re at Walmart and pick up a roll to try for yourself. I think you\u2019ll love them as much as I do. Keep in mind that these do not replace paper towels for food prep. My husband almost stuck the meatballs out of the oven onto one of these to soak the grease up. I was like, noooooooo!!!! I don\u2019t want my meatballs to taste like Dawn dish soap, hahaha!!!\nVisit Bounty on Facebook and on Twitter for news, updates and promotions!\nWhat do you typically use to clean up tough messes?\nI participated in the NIOXIN Challenge blog program as a member of One2One Network. I received free product and compensation but all opinions are my own.\nAll of my life I\u2019ve had thin and really fine hair. I have always struggled with getting curls to stay in or when I style my hair, it just flops after a couple of hours. I remember my mom jumping on me for using rubber bands as ponytail holders cause she said it would break my hair off. They were perfect ponytail holders for me though, because just about anything else would end up loosening and sliding off.\nI found out about the NIOXIN Hair System Kits and jumped at the chance to review one. I had heard rave reviews so I really wanted to try it out. I was asked to do the NIOXIN 30 Day Challenge and then share my experience. NIOXIN has 6 different hair system kits and I chose system 3 for normal to thin-looking hair with color treatment (yes, I color my hair!). Each kit includes an easy 3 step daily regimen including shampoo, conditioner and a treatment.\nThe first thing I noticed when starting the 30 day challenge was the tingling and refreshing sensation on my scalp. Other than that, I didn\u2019t really notice a big difference that first week in my hair. Then by the middle of the 2nd week, I started noticing that my hair was much easier to fix and that my hairstyle would last longer than usual. It just felt fuller as I would curl or straighten my hair.\nBy the end of the 30 day challenge, my husband even noticed a difference just by looking at my hair. He knew that I had a new product in the shower (which I dared him to use, haha!) but he usually doesn\u2019t pay much attention. He\u2019s used to it being flat as a pancake and he came home from work one day and asked if I\u2019d been to my \u201chair guy\u201d. HA! Overall, my hair feels much fuller. I\u2019m very pleased with NIOXIN and will continue using it!\nWe encourage YOU to take the NIOXIN 30 Day Challenge and see if you don\u2019t notice fuller, thicker hair. Click HERE to find the NIOXIN system kit that best suits your needs.

That just makes me smile!!\nWe are making an effort to eat healthier and so we wanted to take something we love\u2026pizza\u2026and give it a healthy tailgating twist without losing any flavor or fun! So I was super excited to try this new pizza tray grill pan from Gourmet Grillware.\nThis pizza tray is so versatile.

It\u2019s made of food safe aluminum alloy which makes for even heating and easy browning on any surface. It also means it isn\u2019t dishwasher safe. But, it\u2019s so easy to clean you won\u2019t even care!\nI know you don\u2019t believe me when I say that this homemade pizza is simple. But trust me, it is SO easy to make! You can whip it up in no time flat.\nMix all ingredients together until you have a dough similar to biscuit dough. It\u2019s not a firm dough. It will be somewhat spreadable.\nPlace your Gourmet Grillware Pizza Tray onto a stove eye on medium/high heat. Spray on some non-stick cooking spray or spread a little vegetable oil on the pan. Plop your dough on and spread it to the thickness that you desire. Let is sit for a bit and brown. Once it\u2019s nice and golden, flip it and brown the other side. Use potholders to carefully remove the pan from the eye. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0 at this point.\nWe chose chicken, zucchinni, onions, garlic and spinach. In a medium pan, with a tablespoon of olive oil my hubby sauteed all the veggies together with a pinch of salt. We keep cooked chicken on hand. He grabbed a chicken breast, chopped it up and threw it in the pan. Once everything was heated through and the onions were translucent, the heat is turned off.\nThis pizza has NO SAUCE! No, I am not kidding. It\u2019s a waste of calories and would overpower the flavors of the veggies. All you do is pour your cooked toppings onto your crust and sprinkle on whatever shredded cheese you may have on hand. Cheese isn\u2019t necessary but can act as a glue to hold all the veggies on the pizza. Throw the pan into your preheated oven and wait for everything to heat up and the cheese to melt.\nCarefully remove your pizza on the Gourmet Grillware Pizza Tray, from the oven. Let it stand for 10 minutes then cut and serve. Another great thing about this pizza tray is that it is also a great serving dish. So you can cut the pizza right on the tough tray and then carry it straight to the table and enjoy!!\nWant to win a set of Gourmet Grillware? You can!

You'll initially receive details regarding HIV, danger aspects for HIV, and also the kinds of various tests. You will have time to ask questions and also talk about any concerns regarding obtaining evaluated. It's your selection to get an examination.\nA non-reactive HIV (negative) examination result means that antibodies to HIV were not found in the blood example. Your examination may come back negative if you have actually been contaminated by HIV very just recently. In most HIV tests, including the quick tests made use of by Heartland CARES, there is a \"home window period\" of about 3 months after an exposure to HIV when antibodies to HIV have not gotten to a degree high enough to be identified.\nIf you recognize along with your testing therapist that you may have been infected in the previous three months, you should be retested 3 months from the date of the feasible exposure to be certain of your result. In the meanwhile, your testing counselor will certainly suggest some actions to help keep you and also your partners healthy and balanced.\nIt's currently suggested that every person 13 years old and over obtain HIV screening as a component of regular exams each year. If you are sexually energetic or sharing needles, testing is recommended every 3-6 months or with a brand-new companion. Not everyone that is contaminated with HIV has symptoms or feels unwell, so getting evaluated and knowing your condition is the only method to know without a doubt that you're negative. It's likewise essential to obtain examined regularly since when HIV is located early, a person can begin therapy immediately before the infection has actually done excessive damage.\nThe variety of new infections in youths makes it crucial that everyone obtains a test and gets a repeat examination if associated with any type of high-risk habits. Determining to get evaluated could be the hardest component, so offer on your own credit score for taking a big step to obtain evaluated.\nNo matter which evaluates a person chooses to do, it's extremely important to constantly get your outcomes, if you have a so-called non-reactive test result you should obtain a second examination within 6 months to confirm you non-reactive (Negative) test outcome.\nA Reactive test result means that HIV antibodies may have been spotted in the specimen.

If the initial oral screening is reactive (favorable), with your authorization, the personnel at Heartland CARES will certainly collect a testing sampling from you before you leave the center to utilize in the confirmatory testing procedure. The outcomes of the confirmatory test typically are offered within 7 to 10 days.\nA Non-Reactive test indicates that anti-HIV antibodies were not identified in the specimen. This test outcome is taken Negative.\nExactly what is a false-positive?\nA false-positive is when an examination returns a preliminary favorable outcome that is later determined (through a confirmatory test) to be imprecise. False-positives are unusual yet are a natural as well as the anticipated incident with all analysis items, consisting of pregnancy examinations, cholesterol examinations and also cancer examinations.\nThe third as well as the last part of testing is getting your outcomes and speaking about what those outcomes imply for the future.\nNon-reactive-- refers to an HIV antibody or HIV antigen/antibody test result that does not show a response to show the existence of HIV antibody and/or antigen. You do not have any type of sign of HIV infection.\nA favorable HIV examination result is when an examination returns an initial favorable outcome as well as must be subsequent with a confirmatory examination in a Health center or center.\nAre all downsides true downsides?\nA Non-Reactive (adverse) examination indicates that anti-HIV antibodies were not found in the specimen. This test result is taken Negative.\nIt is feasible to get an unfavorable testing examination if the infection is really current. This could be since there is a home window period of a number of weeks when an individual may be contaminated but antibodies to the infection have actually not reached a concentration that is visible. Consequently, if a person has particular danger variables, or assumes they could have been subjected to HIV, they have to be retested in three months to be particular of an adverse outcome.

{"text": "Why Owners and Tenants need to have Contents Insurance?\nOwners and tenants both have contents in a property so it\u2019s important that both parties are adequately insured to make sure that valuable possessions are protected. Contents insurance covers the financial cost of repairing or replacing possessions if they are damaged or lost and can include items such as furniture, blinds, clothes, fridges, televisions, computers, tools and jewellery. Below is a brief guide on where to start if you\u2019re looking for contents insurance, whether you\u2019re a tenant or property owner.\nAs an owner, you are responsible for any contents in the property, even if the property is not provided furnished. Items like floating floors, carpets, dishwashers and blinds fall under contents, so it\u2019s very important to have these items covered in your building and/or landlord policy. Contents insurance is not just for people who own their own home, it is also important for people renting a home; as a tenant, you are responsible for the contents and belongings that you bring to the property. If the worst should happen, the landlord\u2019s building insurance will only cover the property the landlord owns \u2013 a tenant\u2019s belongings are not included.\nWho is responsible for contents?\nAs a tenant, if you accidentally or intentionally damage the building or contents of the property you are renting, you must notify the agent or owner as soon as possible to ensure correct repairs and insurance procedures can be put in place. You will be expected to pay for repairs or replacement.\nIf the damage is caused by a third party or the event was outside the control of the tenant or owner, for example, a break-in or storm, then each party will be responsible to replace or repair any contents that they own. If the tenant\u2019s belongings are damaged by a building fault such as a ceiling collapsing or roof leak, then a third party will need to determine if the damage was caused by negligence. If the damage was not caused by the owner\u2019s negligence, then the tenant will be responsible for to repair or replace their own contents.\nThe type of insurance you choose will affect the premium you pay (the premium is the price charged by the insurance company for providing the insurance cover). Some policies cover you for defined events (e.g. burglary or fire) while others may cover you for any accidental event. Some policies may even give you limited cover if you take an item (e.g. laptop or mobile phone) outside of your home.\nValuable items may need to be insured for a higher specific value or listed separately under the policy otherwise they might not be covered for their full value or may even be excluded from the claim.\n\u2018New for old\u2019 policies are usually more expensive, so you will need to work out what level of cover you want and weigh up the costs. You may be able to save money on the type of insurance by choosing a higher excess (the excess is the amount of an insurance claim that consumers have to pay). For example, you may choose to pay the first $1000 of any loss, therefore reducing the insurance premium. Bundling is also a great way to save on insurance. Tenants can combine motor vehicle, health and contents policies. For owners, a contents policy is usually covered in a Landlord Protection Policy or you can add it to a building policy.\nIf you require more information, it\u2019s best to speak directly to an insurance company or talk to a few to see who can offer the best deal. You may also like to consider using the services of an insurance broker who will be able to give you information on multiple insurance policies from multiple companies.\nRachael Stevenson is a Property Manager at Empire Estate Agents.

Let me give you an example of what I mean. I grew up in church, but when I got older, I decided to do my own thing. As a result, I was a single mother making $12,000 a year. I was at an all time low, and there was only one person who could help me out of the hole I created. Jesus forgave me of my sin, but I still had to be a mother. I still had to endure making huge sacrifices for my child to be okay. I had to go from thinking about what to wear out on a Friday night with my friends, to staying up all night with my sick, asthmatic baby.\nMy sins were forgiven, but the consequences were mine. There were days harder than others, but I had the confidence of knowing Christ was with me. Some days were extremely hard but I never truly felt alone. I had made some huge mistakes and suffered at the hands of others, but none of that determined my future. Soon I met and married a wonderful man who loved both my daughter and I.

Cerys, meanwhile, had parked up in a 12-seater tour bus bigger than the wooden hall. We waited outside, snaking down the hill as she went through an extensive soundcheck where that unmistakeable Cardiff birdsong travelled on the night air towards Kirkbymoorside.\nSupport act Alun Tan Lan sang entirely in Welsh - disappointingly the Welsh word for bicycle turned out to be bike - and when Cerys's American band emerged into the twinkling fairylights they had the look of hick farmboys unlikely to sleep before the morning milking session.\nCerys tucked her hair beneath a Sixties' peaked cap and sipped on the sweet Yorkshire nectar of a Black Sheep beer to bathe her voice through a gleeful set of ramshackle country beauty, roadhouse blues and sometimes chaotic, chugging rock that began, against all expectations, with Catatonia's valedictory lament, Godspeed.\nNo woman since Janis Joplin sings with such abandon, eyes in ecstasy, mouth so wide, voice untamed and wild, tender yet burning.\nTo round off a rowdy Saturday, curry for 20 from JB Spice arrived, and Cerys was last spotted carrying a child-booster seat to the monster bus.\nThat's rock'n'roll, Band Room style.\n\"Sarah, Magdalena & I went to see Cerys Matthews & her band at the Band Room, Farndale, here in the foothills of the North Yorkshire Moors last Saturday night. (Cerys comes into The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, because she helped Bucky Baxter build a studio in the woods... in a place almost as out-of-the-way as the Band Room.) Her website doesn't admit the existence of this gig at all, but in reality it was the opening night of her tour. How her big blue double-decker tour bus made it over the bridge at Low Mill I don't know.\nThis was the venue we wanted Dylan to come to, a year or two back ... [he] still should, since every \"name\" act that does play the Band Room (capacity 80-100) finds it the most charming, funkily intimate venue they've ever played, and in the most beautiful possible setting.\nCerys Matthews certainly seemed to enjoy herself, and she was terrific: full of life, openness, playful zest and integrity - and an authority that didn't posture or ever become pseudo-masculine - and her fine band achieved a nifty balance between engaging thought-out arrangements and bright improvisation, setting Ms Matthews free to play as little or as much as she felt like, moment by moment, and to sing out with exuberant confidence.\nThe support act was a young man whose entire repertoire was sung in Welsh, though he addressed the audience in English between songs. He sang sweetly, and played excellent acoustic guitar, but as men with cigars will be telling him, if he wants to get anywhere he'll have to swallow his nationalist pride and sing in the global language of English.\"\nso anyweezle I'm in the very small car park of a very small venue in north western england. please please check out the website.\nwww.thebandroom.co.uk the place is absolutely cute and the surrounding country side is full of beauty and peace. this is one of those times you can write something like that and be completely not embarrased because it's just plain true. we're in farndale I think? I don't know but it's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. rolling vallies peppered with cute old little stone houses. it took quite the manuevering to get the bus down here to this place.\nanyways blah blah blah backstage sitting around. but then all the sudden we were told that the food was ready and went out into the performance space and there was a big table (two fold out tables put together) with a cool table cloth and a spread of food that made me wet my eyes! (that'd be a funny saying wouldn't it?) oh my gosh... indian food! they had bought it from a place down the road and prepared it in their kitchen and now were presenting it to us. the nahn (sp.?) was amazing. like real deal nahn out of the clay pot. two kinds of curry and rice. by the way, the lights were all down and there were a bunch of candles in the middle of the table. so the band and crew and the organizers all set down to a nice indian meal in some tiny hardly-can-be-called-a-town town somewhere in rural england. man the mixes of cultures in this place are amazin'.\nI set next to a guy named mark on my right. mark, for a living, oh builds walls. yep, those picturesque lil' diddies that you see dividing inheritances all over UK country-sides, yep those kinds of walls. with tools, he held up his hands to illustrate the tools he used. wow, that's a man.\nand across from me set tim. he was one of the main organizers. he's wise. or at least really smart. no, I'd say wise. after the meal me and our sound guy andy and tim got into a political discussion about how america and the rest of the world. won't get into all of it, but he had a real rational viewpoint. he just felt warm and down to earth..\nAlun has been playing solo since February 2004, since then he has released 2 albums on the Rasal label , the first Aderyn Papur in August 2004 and the second Y Distawrwydd in August 2005. He's currently working on the third which will see light of day in January 2007 on the Aderyn Papur label. In between woooing the masses on Cunard line cruise ships he finds time to play guitar in Euros Childs's band and also moonlights for Gwyneth Glyn on bass, banjo and mandolin.\n\"Local boy making good. well travelled, well talented, well too good to be tied down. crackin music, gigs hard, respect. catch him if you can.

{"text": "Home > All about hedgehogs > Do hedgehogs have fleas?\nTicks are another common external parasite on hedgehogs. Usually an individual will have a couple of ticks on it though occasionally there are hedgehogs with heavier burdens. Ticks often attach themselves to the underside, behind the ears or the flanks of hedgehogs but they can occur elsewhere as well. Ticks are in general harmless to hedgehogs. However, a high parasite load can be indicative of sickness.\nHedgehogs often get ringworm, with around a quarter of the national population thought to be affected. Most hedgehogs show no visible symptoms and even those with severe infections can still show little sign of skin infection and can feed normally. Dry, crusty ears are one of the most common symptoms of a ringworm infection.\n\u2192 What do I do if I\u2019ve seen a dead or diseased hedgehog?", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T07:18:05Z", "url": "https://www.hedgehogstreet.org/about-hedgehogs/fleas/", "byte_size": 850, "char_size": 846}

{"text": "At some point in the night, The Eden dropped cargo at Port Eden, the only human habitation of this long route. The village of 60 souls doesn\u2019t have a proper pier, so transfer of goods and people is done by lowering the stern ramp (where the trucks drive on when in port) while standing off the town in, one hopes, calm weather, and loading a smaller launch which returns to dry land. This was all effected while I slept, though I wish I\u2019d been able to watch. Puerto Eden is an intriguing corner of the world, just about as isolated as a place can be in the world today. In yesterday\u2019s briefing, our resident polymath warned of this afternoon\u2019s passage, as this was the one part of the voyage where the boat headed out into the open ocean. Given that there is little else going on (no news, sports, or any other outside diversions), impending 7 meter seas, the sturdiness of our old boat, and the relative merits motion sickness drugs were constant topics of conversation.\nThe morning was bright, and I visited the bridge which looked like a computer lab\u2014 no big wooden wheel, or that metal crank on a post that marks \u201call ahead full\u201d \u2014just some monitors, joysticks, without even a person who seemed to be standing the helm. I had the chance to lunch with an adventurous Australian couple who has been on some wild treks on the Patagonian coast to generally unvisited glaciers. We were soon joined by the older American woman, and the conversation turned to America\u2019s obsession with firearms. Of course she turned out to be a gun-toting, Fox News watching, border wall building nut. I watched as a sense of dismay spread across the faces of the Aussies, showing utter disbelief at the level of paranoia they were witnessing. They, along with two other Australian couples later questioned me seriously (as I was the only other representative of the USA on board), wanting to understand how pervasive the nuttiness really is. Sometimes I find it difficult to answer that question as I feel the same incredulity as they.\nWe hail\u2019d it in God\u2019s name.\nNobody shot the albatross, the storm held off, but as we progressed into the bay, the swells did swell, Soon the ship was being tossed about and many passengers (drugged or not, I\u2019m uncertain) disappeared to do a little tossing of their own. The rest of us remained on deck as long as the weather permitted, then I repaired to the lounge where the vinyl leatherette couches lurched from port to starboard, waking sleepers and smashing thumbs (mine). Walkers staggered like drunk sailors and loose objects flew about like this morning\u2019s albatross (though not as gracefully). The crew managed with aplomb (surely a regular occurrence on this route), served dinner with little mishap (an unattended tray or two were launched across the space). The passage was to take more than twelve hours, and fortunately the movement was slow enough that it didn\u2019t bother my stomach. I was able to read through the afternoon, and went to bed early (though using the head as we pitched about was a challenge) and at some point in the night woke to calm seas. We had re-entered the canals, navigating in the dark I\u2019m guessing by computers and not by following albatrosses.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T17:02:45Z", "url": "http://walkinghome.lmc.gatech.edu/in-patagonia/in-patagonia-day-25/", "byte_size": 3229, "char_size": 3199}

The country is politically very unstable.\nThe Reform message entered the country in 1939 with Pastor Carlos Kozel\u2019s visit; and one year later, in 1940, two Peruvian missionaries (Brothers Jos\u00e9 Carmen Le\u00f3n and Heraclio Begazo) were sent to work in the country. By 1943 there were 30 interested souls attending church services. After the first church was organized in the capital city of La Paz, the message was taken to most cities. On December 23, 1963, the Bolivian Field of the Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement was legally registered as a missionary fields of the General Conference with its headquarters in Germany at the time.\nIn 1975, the General Conference put the Bolivian Field under the management of the Peruvian Union; and then in 1986 Bolivia once again became a missionary field under the General Conference.\nFrom January 1992 to 1995, when there were already 324 members, the church had a collapse that brought about great difficulties. Only 205 members remained firm in the true faith. Due to this problem, the work started over with three churches, one vehicle, and 10% of the publications of the publishing house. The situation was very precarious.\nBut now, thanks to God and the sacrifices made by local and foreign Bible workers and pastors, the Bolivian Field has 317 members and was recently organized as a Union. Although it is weak financially, some donations and the cooperation of our brethren have made it possible for the Union to purchase a piece of land measuring 1,700 square meters (18,299 square feet) in the city of Cochabamba for the purpose of constructing a headquarters building.\nWe appeal to all the believers in the world to help us carry out our construction plans, for we cannot do this by ourselves.

{"text": "Massive changes to how public schools will be allowed to hire builders for large construction projects, as well as harsh new penalties for malfeasance that occurs during the selection process are included in the $10.4 billion budget passed by Arizona lawmakers and signed by Gov. Doug Ducey last week.\nSome in the construction industry \u2014 who were not consulted on the changes and fear a return to a system that prioritizes cost above outcomes \u2014 say the changes are a legislative overreaction to scandals that have roiled the Scottsdale Unified School District since late 2017.\nThe most significant change involves how construction companies will be selected. Beginning July 2019, instead of using a process that allows districts to subjectively score and select a construction manager to manage the entire project, builders will be selected based solely on who promises the lowest cost.\nOther provisions aim to prevent undue influence over the procurement process by restricting who gets to be part of the selection process and banning gifts given by contractors to district officials.\nThe legislation marks a shot across the bow from lawmakers who say they see problems in the school construction industry and want to be sure taxpayers are getting maximum value from expensive construction projects.\n\u201cIt was all aimed at trying to address corruption in financial management and procurement practices,\u201d said House Speaker J.D. Mesnard, R-Chandler.\nSome of these specifications are already included in the Arizona Board of Education's administrative code. The law authorizes the attorney general to investigate and interview people under oath if there is a reason to believe any of the yet-to-be-written rules have been violated.\nKnowingly avoiding the new rules will be a class 4 felony. Violations of the gift ban will be a class 6 felony for anything with a value above $300 and a class 6 misdemeanor for anything with a value below $300.\nCharter schools will be exempt from the new rules.\nMesnard said the changes are in direct response to a scandal in Scottsdale Unified School District, in which the district\u2019s superintendent and other district officials were discovered to have financial ties to an architect who was given a large construction project.\nHunt & Caraway, the architectural firm selected by the school, had paid the district\u2019s superintendent $30,000 in 2016.\nDocuments also showed that Hunt & Caraway was paid, and the company\u2019s executives knew the firm would receive the contract, before the district had finished its selection process.\nThe revelation led to the firing of the superintendent and other district employees.\nBut Minter, of the Arizona Builders Alliance, said the changes were made without consulting stakeholders in the construction and architecture industries. Had lawmakers done so, Minter said industry experts would have warned them about the dangers of returning to a low-bid system like what Arizona used until the late 1990s.\nMany public works projects ended up in lawsuits, he said, because a low-bid environment creates an \u201cinstant adversarial environment\u201d between architects, contractors, subcontractors and project owners \u2014 in this case, school districts.\nRebekah Morris, the publisher of Arizona Builders Exchange, a construction trade publication that tracks public procurements, said the changes to the procurement laws for school districts will, ironically, lead to increased costs because of litigation.\n\u201cIt is counter-productive. You\u2019re going a huge step backwards if this actually does take effect,\u201d she said.\nMesnard said he expects the Arizona Board of Education will define \u201cqualified bidders\u201d when it crafts the rules to implement the law.\nArizona Center for Investigative Reporting (AZCIR) and KJZZ reported in 2017 on the interwoven financial relationships between a small group of architects, construction companies and subcontractors and the school districts in Maricopa County where the companies seek business.\nThe investigation showed that, between 2013 and 2016, architects, construction firms and subcontractors accounted for nearly all of the financial contributions made to Maricopa County districts\u2019 bond and override campaigns. If voters approved the property tax increases, they funded construction projects sought by the builders.\nAZCIR found that nine companies \u2014 three architecture firms, three construction firms, and three subcontractors \u2014 accounted for half of all public school procurement awards in Maricopa County for bond-related projects. Those same companies gave nearly 60 percent of the money raised by school bond and override campaign committees in Maricopa County during those years. Overall, construction companies accounted for roughly 90 percent of all campaign giving for such campaigns.\nMorris said she has been paying close attention to the school procurements since 2015, and the pattern of awarded contracts indicates something other than standard competitive bidding.\nMinter, of the Arizona Builders Alliance, disagreed with Morris. He said market concentration occurs in every industry.\nParents concerned about construction at SUSD's Hopi Elementary School originally raised concerns with the district's construction practices. Pictured here is new construction at the school on April 25, 2018.\nPublic procurements for construction projects by community colleges, universities and municipalities in Arizona showed dramatically more distribution among different companies.\nMorris said that the construction manager at risk (CMAR) and job order contract (JOC) procurement methods currently in use by school districts leaves open the possibility that the contractors can manipulate the market.\nBoth methods have a subjective selection process that allow other factors to be considered in addition to overall cost. Additionally, CMAR gives the company hired to manage the project wide discretion over which other contractors end up working on a project.\nIf contractors were manipulating the market, Morris said, the results of AZCIR\u2019s 2017 analysis is what it would look like.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be explained by an actually competitive procurement process,\u201d she said.\nBetween now and when the new law goes into effect in July 2019, Minter said he and other construction industry advocates plans to meet with lawmakers and discuss how more nuanced adjustments to the existing CMAR and JOC systems can be implemented while still keeping them in place.\nMesnard said he is open to altering the new law when the legislature reconvenes in January 2019.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be the end of the conversation (on) procurement in school districts,\u201d he said.\nThis is a collaboration between KJZZ and the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting, an independently funded, non-profit news organization.\nAccording to procurement records compiled by AZBEX, between 2013 and 2016, a group of three architects, three construction firms and three subcontractors ended up winning contracts for more than half of all K-12 projects.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T13:01:31Z", "url": "https://theshow.kjzz.org/content/640203/deconstructed-arizona-upends-school-procurement-laws-effort-cool-cozy-relationships", "byte_size": 7050, "char_size": 6998}

{"text": "According to one narrative, the Timberwolves decided after Friday\u2019s loss to the Kings to trade Jimmy Butler.\nBut he might have forced their hand, resulting in his trade to the 76ers.\nButler decided he would play on Friday night, but he viewed it as the fork in the road. If the Timberwolves didn\u2019t find a deal to fulfill his long-simmering trade request after that, he would begin to sit indefinitely, league sources told The Athletic.\nThe Kings defeated Minnesota 121-110 to push the Timberwolves to 4-9 and a winless road trip; Butler had 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in 41 minutes. He had played almost 124 minutes in the last three games, all losses, and at halftime of the final one, the Wolves were informed that this was it for Butler, sources said.\nButler reportedly held out for a game a couple weeks ago, though he and Minnesota both denied it. It\u2019s quite believable he would\u2019ve held out again if not traded. Still, informing the team during a game he\u2019s playing would have been quite bold.\nI\u2019m not sure who actually blinked first.

{"text": "Tai Chi and Chi Kung Institute: What is Tai Chi?\nNew Beginners Term 2 - 2019 .\nCourses are conducted during the state school terms.\nDiscount Coupon \"2 for 1\"\nWhy is Tai Chi used for relaxation and stress management?\nAm I too old/young to learn Tai Chi?\nWhat equipment do I need to practice Tai Chi?\nWhere does Tai Chi come from?\nWhere should I begin when learning Tai Chi?\nWhat happens after I've learned the set?\nHow does Tai Chi compare to Chi Kung?\nAvailable at classes or by mail.\nTai Chi is a major branch of the traditional Chinese sport of Wu Shu. As a means of keeping fit, preventing and curing diseases it has been practiced since the 16th century. Its prime purpose is to promote health in a slow relaxed manner, without jarring and hurting one's body. The movements are slow, with great emphasis on posture and balance.\nThe exercise requires a high degree of concentration, with the mind free of distractions. Breathing is natural, sometimes involving abdominal respiration, and its performance is in rhythmic harmony with body movements.\nOriginally developed as a martial art, the movements of Tai Chi were quickly recognized as being beneficial to the body. The major emphasis of Tai Chi today is on its health benefits, although it may still be used as a system of self-defense after years of training and practice.\nTai Chi makes an ideal complement to sport or other martial arts training as a warm up or warm down technique.\nWhat are the health benefits of practicing Tai Chi?\nPromote a general sense of well-being.\nThe Tai Chi practitioner concentrates on breathing and fluidity of form. During the exercise all outside thoughts are swept away and only the task on hand is deemed important. It is for this reason that in the West, Tai Chi is now highly regarded for relieving stress and tension.\nResearch by the Tai Chi & Chi Kung Institute however, has shown that those looking for stress management can gain more immediate relaxation benefits from Chi Kung classes, even at a very basic level.\nGenerally, relaxation gained from performing Tai Chi begins after the set has been learned.\nThere is generally no age limit with Tai Chi - both young and old can practice the art. However, we provide specially tailored classes for children in primary schools and older persons. As classes are conducted for the purpose of slow and relaxing exercise, which involves deep concentration, it is not appropriate to have anyone in a public class who may cause distractions (such as young, noisy children).\nAs no sports equipment, uniform or special grounds are required, Tai Chi can be done at any time and in any place. All you need is a small amount of open space, some loose, comfortable clothing and some flat-soled shoes that won't slip off during your practice. If possible, make sure that the sole of your shoe is flexible - some running shoes are too stiff for Tai Chi practice.\nThe term \"Tai Chi\" is an accepted English equivalent of the Chinese word \"Taijiquan\" (T\u00e0ij\u00edqu\u00e1n), where \"Tai\" means \"grand\" or \"supreme\", \"ji\" means \"ultimate\" and \"quan\" means \"fist\" or \"boxing\" (the Chinese characters for this word are shown to the right).\nIt is accepted that the origin of Tai Chi was in the Chen Village in China. Today there are five main styles of Tai Chi: Chen, Yang, Wu, Sun and Woo (Hao). Each style is named for the family which traditionally created the style. Although each of the five styles has characteristics of its own, the essence of all are the same. The most popular style in China today is Yang style.\nBeginning students at the Tai Chi & Chi Kung Institute are taught the Yang Tai Chi in 24 Forms (or Beijing 24) set. This set has been used in China for the mass promotion of Tai Chi and is taught in China by government institutions such as the Beijing University of Physical Education.\nWe believe that this set provides a good foundation for our students, which they can consolidate in their individual Tai Chi practice and build upon with intermediate and advanced sets.\nTai Chi is generally not easy for the beginning student. While it is not physically hard or strenuous, remembering the movements and co-ordinating the mind with the body can be challenging. Like most arts (such at painting or music), to do it well takes a lot of physical practice and intellectual study to understand the movements and gain the maximum health benefit from the exercise.\nIf you have little time to devote to your practice, but you are looking for relaxation and a pleasant, meditative feeling, we recommend Chi Kung - it is easier to learn and can provide relaxation benefits to the student immediately.\nOnce the set is learned, the student can continue to practice their Tai Chi for refinement and relaxation. Tai Chi learned well is a wonderful way to exercise!\nThe Institute offers Chi Kung (which you can learn at the same time as Tai Chi if you wish), or you can continue on to intermediate and advanced sets of Tai Chi, Weapon sets and Shaolin Arts.\nChi Kung is a health exercise based on Traditional Chinese Medicine theory. It emphasises the flow of Chi through the acupuncture meridians and is excellent for calming the mind and regulating the breath. On the other hand, Tai Chi emphasises the natural movement of the joints and muscles and increases circulation and is excellent for improving the focus of the mind.\nFor the beginning student, Tai Chi forms and movements are more complicated than Chi Kung forms and movements, therefore requiring more effort to learn them. You will need time to practice, patience with yourself and perseverance.\nThe classes are structured quite differently. Chi Kung students are guided through the exercises by the Instructor, while Tai Chi classes place a greater emphasis on the student, who first watches the Instructor, practices the movement and then tries out the movement on their own.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T04:57:31Z", "url": "http://www.taichi.com.au/taichi.html", "byte_size": 5864, "char_size": 5861}

That's why it's important to consider the both growth rate and dividend payout ratio. But long-term investors who are saving for retirement, a child's college fund, or even to pass assets down to their descendants will want to consider dividend growth above all else.

{"text": "Restorative Yoga for Strength- Benefits!\nThousands of years ago yoga originated in India, and in present day and age, an alarming awareness was observed in health and natural remedies among people by yoga and pranayama which has been proven an effective method for improving health in addition to prevention and management of diseases. With increasing scientific research in yoga, its therapeutic aspects are also being explored.\nYoga is reported to reduce stress and anxiety, improves autonomic functions by triggering neurohormonal mechanisms by the suppression of sympathetic activity, and even, nowadays, several reports suggested yoga is beneficial for the physical health of cancer patients. Such global recognition of yoga also testifies to India\u2019s growing cultural influence.\nSo why is building strength important?\nIt improves bone density, reducing our risk of osteoporosis.\nWe naturally lose lean muscle mass as part of the aging process. Strength training can help to preserve it. Stronger muscles help to stabilize the joints. This can help to prevent injuries \u2013 especially important for those with hypermobile joints.Strength training helps to improve resting metabolic rate.\nIt has also been shown to have a positive effect on our mental health, including reductions in anxiety, depression, and pain intensity; improved sleep and confidence, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and resilience.\nDoes yoga count as strength training?\nThe short answer is \u2026 it depends. There are so many different ways to practice that it\u2019s not possible just to prescribe only \u2018yoga\u2019 to get stronger. Certain types of yoga like Yin and Restorative will not help you build muscle and nor should they, but with asanas such as Warrior poses, Planks, arm balances and inversions, we are in effect \u201cweight training\u201d as we support our own body weight in gravity.\nWhen we practice yoga poses we involve the whole body, rather than trying to isolate specific muscles \u2013 like when using fixed gym machines. We recruit other muscle groups to act as stabilizers, as well as the muscles where the main action takes places. In this way, yoga can be a great form of functional strength training. Meaning building strength in the whole body so that it can perform daily activities in the real world, not just lifting a certain amount of weight.\nCan you gain strength with Yoga?\nCan you tone your body with yoga?\nPracticing yoga poses, or asanas will give you a long, limber look while also improving your cardiovascular health and overall wellness. Weights and machines are not required to tone your body in yoga. In certain poses, however, you are lifting your own body weight.\nIs yoga enough for strength training?\nMaybe, if you\u2019ve never done any strength training and the yoga you practice is challenging enough that your muscles feel as though they are getting fatigued as you hold the asanas, or poses. Like Pilates, yoga is an excellent toning tool, and beginners can make significant strength gains.\nWant to try a restorative and toning yoga class with Manali?\nCheck this out and register!\n10 Tips to Overcome Depression!\nFinding Calmness among the Chaos!\nAs my gift to you, I would like to send you a copy of my book \u201cLove Yourself- Zen in Your Everyday Life\u201d because I believe that this is the key to a truly balanced life.\nYou also get a first free 30 minutes Reiki or Lifestyle Coaching In-person or Skype session with Manali.\nSign up to get these special gifts!", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T16:45:51Z", "url": "https://www.zenforyou.ca/restorative-yoga-for-strength-benefits/", "byte_size": 3467, "char_size": 3443}
{"text": "A mattress for side sleepers? What about a mattress for back or stomach sleepers? Why is there a mattress designed specifically for side sleepers? The mattress must meet the unique needs that a side sleeper needs. The mattress should have a good temperature control so the person can sleep comfortably. The mattress should be reasonably priced and specifically designed for people who like to habitually sleep on their sides. The mattress must give this type of sleeper strong support for their backs, necks and legs, and feet. If the person likes to bend their legs while they sleep or they like to sleep with their legs straight the mattress must be able to meet these needs. This is why memory foam would be good to have so it will form to the person\u2019s peculiar sleeping position.\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress is supposed to have 3.5 gel memory foam that conforms to your body. It Will keep the spine aligned and prevent tossing and turning during the night. It does not allow for motion transfer and it will help you have a great night\u2019s sleep. It is lined with New Zealand wool which absorbs moisture and controls the temperature. It will also stop odor from absorbing into the mattress. It contains no harsh chemicals or chemicals that are flame retardant. The mattress is great for side sleepers and the company offers a limited 25 year limited warranty. The mattress is rolled up and compressed into the box for easy shipping.\nFeedback: The mattress had over 2200 review written about it. The customer has rheumatoid arthritis and says she can sleep on the sorest parts of her body and she has no pain. The pressure points are fine and she woke up at 7:30 in the morning and she felt like she had slept until 11:00 a.m. She was afraid to sleep on memory foam but she now has no reservations about it.\nThe customer said they researched the product thoroughly and decided to buy this memory foam mattress. He had tried several other memory foam mattresses in the past. He ordered the product and it was delivered to the front door. The customer was told the box weighed 102 lbs. and the customer was impressed with how compact the mattress was in the box. He dragged the box to the bed the mattress was to go on. He took it out of the box and he let the mattress air out for s night. He slept in another room and the next night he slept on the new mattress. He slept fine until 3:00 am and then he woke up with the sweats. He slept off and on until the morning. He slept on the mattress the next night but he put a fan near the mattress to cool it down. The fan got the room to cool so he had to set the fan at a higher speed. He developed an acute tailbone lower backache. He could not afford this injury because he does heavy lifting at his work. He decided to return the product so he contacted Amazon. The rep said since the mattress had human contact that Amazon could not return the product. The rep said his credit card would be fully reimbursed. He could not believe Amazon would give the money back without taking the mattress back. Amazon told him to give the mattress away. The customer rated the product 2-stars. You cannot blame him for giving the product such a low-rating.\nThe customer says this is the best mattress he has ever had except for a very expensive one his ex got to keep. This mattress did not sink in the middle or lose his form. He has had very good nights of sleep on the mattress and he gave it a 5-star rating. He highly recommends the product. This is a great mattress for the price. the customer says they have the mattress for a month and so far so good. The mattress is firm and the client likes to sleep on firm mattresses.\nThe customer is disabled and cannot go to the store to try out a mattress to see what it is really like before he would buy it. He tried this mattress and was disgusted with it because it was not firm at all. He showed a picture of himself sitting on the mattress. It sagged a good 6 to 8 inches when the mattress was 13 inches high. It is definitely not a firm mattress. The customer is tired of reading reviews that do not meet his expectations concerning the product. He thinks maybe the reviews are fake because they seem to be wrong most of the time. Being a disabled person he really needs the reviews to accurately reflect the quality of the product. He called Amazon and they said to give the mattress away but we will still fully refund your money. He likes the way Amazon takes care of the customers. The customer rated the product one-star.\nThe couple bought the mattress 3 years ago and they are disgusted with the product. They slept well on it at first but now they wake up in the morning with aches and pains. The mattress sagged in certain spots making it tougher to sleep. The rotated the mattress to try and alleviate the sags it did not work. They could not flip the mattress over because the thickness on the bottom is different than on the top. The customer said this mattress is only 3-years-old and is a lousy product. The customers rated the product 2-stars. The mattress was a solid mattress and it was easy to set up. The wife and husband were people of average weight so they cannot understand why the mattress would sag. They will not buy the product again and they do not recommend the product.\nBenefits and Uses: It is a knitted polyester and tencel blended fabric which will relieve tension on your shoulders and hips. The mattress is great for side sleepers and is so soft you will think you\u2019re sleeping in the clouds. The mattresses 4 layers will have you sleeping in optimal comfort. The top panel supplies you with comfort. The memory gel section alleviates pressure and gives you support while you sleep. The internal breathable layer keeps you cool while you sleep. The foundational layer comes in soft, medium, and firm designations. You order what you want. The mattress comes with a 10-year non-prorated warranty and a 120 night comfort guarantee.\nFeedback: The customer said the mattress came in 18 inches and 41 inches square. It came in a heavy plastic shipping bag and it was easy to roll out of the bag. The customer put it on the mattress box and they waited two hours to sleep on the mattress. Contrary to what they had read and heard the mattress had no odor. The customer said they slept well on the mattress and that it was a foam mattress and not a memory mattress. The customer is right it is not a memory mattress but a foam mattress. The customer does not want a memory mattress. The customer rated the product 5-stars.\nThe customer rated the product 5-stars and said it was very easy to set up. The product is very comfortable and this is all the customer writes. This is not a detailed review and tells us nothing about the quality of the product. Why is it great? Is it firm? Is it soft? The customer does not say why they rated the product 5-stars. The customer does not write if they slept soundly during the night or that they woke up refreshed in the morning. We do not know if the customer woke up in pain or if any previous pains were alleviated. This review has no selling value for future customers. The review is too general and neutral to convince anyone to buy or not to buy the product.\nThis is not a very positive review because the customer rated the product 3-stars. Which really is an average rating. The customer bought a medium and firm mattress. The couple decided to sleep on the firm mattress and put the medium mattress in the guest room. The wife has had back issues for years and needed the firm support. The husband weighs 200 lbs and needs to find a comfortable position to sleep in. The firm mattress met this requirement. Despite this seemingly positive review, the customer rated the product 3-stars which sends strong mixed signals. The review will not convince people to buy the product.\nThe customer says the mattress is like sleeping on a cloud as they said in their own words. They tried the mattress in the store and the longer they laid on it the better they liked it. They selected the firm mattress and they have rated the product 5-stars. They wrote the review the day this article was written 7/16/2018. So, it remains to be seen what the customer thinks about the product down the road.\nThe customer pays the mattress was easy to set up and is comfortable to sleep on but they did not say why it was easy to set up or why it was so comfortable for them to lay on. The customer rated the product 5-stars. Two women wrestled the box mattress upstairs without any extra help. They said once you get it out the box take it right to where it will be slept on. This is because the mattress once it comes out of the box it expands rapidly so you do not have a lot of time to move the mattress. They put it in the guest room but quickly moved it to the master bedroom because it was too good to leave in the guest room. The mattress is nice and the customer rated the product 5-stars.\nBenefits and Uses: Hopefully the mattress is worthy of the robust price tag it carries-$3599 which is very expensive. The mattress is 11.8 inches thick and it is made of temperature material. Or it will control the temperature as you sleep giving you a comfortable sleep. It helps to spread the body weight evenly across the bed helping you to sleep without waking up sore in the morning. The cover is made of breathable, cooling material that keeps the surface of the mattress cool. The mattress material is designed with cooling benefits and it draws heat from the body.\nFeedback: The customer says the mattress is working very well for them. They use to lay down and could not sleep and on top of it they would wake up sore. Now, with this mattress as soon as they lay down they fall asleep. They wake up in the morning without feeling sore. They would wake up every morning sore when they slept on the other mattress. The client rated it 5-stars. The customer says they wanted to wait before they wrote this review and the finally got around to writing the review. They wanted to sleep on the bed for awhile before making a report and they wrote their report. The customer said they always thought they would sleep on a coil mattress but they bought this one instead.\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress is designed to controls the temperature while you sleep and the memory gel contours to the body for a top night of sleep. 2 inches of memory foam sit on 8 inches of density foam with a soft foam cover. Like so many other mattresses the gel foam draws heat away from the body.\nFeedback: The customer at first did not like the mattress because it gave her a \u201csinking\u201d feeling. She sank in the mattress and it felt mushy. She called the rep and the rep said they would send a firmer mattress. But after 3 days the mattress became firmer and the customer fell in love with the mattress and canceled the order for a firmer mattress. The customer kept the medium mattress and she is sleeping very comfortably. Her husband loves the mattress as well and the customer is not waking up hot and sweaty during the night. The customer has rated the mattress 5-stars.\nThe customer has been using the mattress for quite awhile and it is just as supportive as it was on day one. The twin mattresses are working wonderfully for the customer and the bed doubles as a daybed and a night bed. The customer flips the mattress around but due to construction, the mattress cannot be flipped over. The customer weighs 140 pounds so keep this in mind as you read the review. If you are heavier than this customer\u2019s 140 lbs the bed may not work for you. The Customer says the mattress is as good as some mattresses that may cost a lot more than this one. The customer would buy the mattress again. The customer expects the mattress to last for years. The customer rated the product 5-stars.\nThe customer bought this mattress to replace a $1200 dollar mattress the client owned before. This mattress is as good as that $1200.00 dollar mattress. The mattress was easy to set up and the customer is the mattress is working very well. The customer sleeps peacefully every night on the mattress. The customer says it is worth 5-stars and will update in the future if any problems arise. The customer said the odor from the mattress dissipated quickly and the customer was glad about this.\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress has 2.5 inches of gel material on the top with 8.5 inches of deluxe base material. Supposedly the mattress brings a top luxury hotel feel to the home according to the company. The company claims that 90% of the reviews rated the mattress 5-stars. The mattress is able to relieve pressure points which prevents you from tossing and turning all night. The product will relieve shoulder, back and hip pain. The mattress is supposed to give you a delightful night of sleep.\nFeedback: The company did not tell the truth they said 90% of the reviews were 5-stars. There were 77% of the reviews that rated the product 5-stars. Oh, this is great because the customer receives the mattress and the customer opens the box and finds some of the seams on the mattress were ripping on a brand-new mattress. The delivery guy will not take the mattress back because it is opened. The customer needs to return the mattress. What are they supposed to do now? It sure seems like the company cannot be trusted because they lied about how many 5-star reviews they received for the product and now this customer receives a new mattress that has seams ripping.\nWe have taken a look at some mattresses that will help you if you are a side sleeper and they will help you sleep comfortably with no aches or pains when you wake up in the morning. One downside in the reviews is one of the company\u2019s lied about how many 5-stars reviewed they received for their mattress. It would be to a customer\u2019s advantage to avoid this company. You will see which company it is in the review list above.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T04:14:36Z", "url": "https://www.activebeautiful.com/best-mattress-for-side-sleepers/", "byte_size": 13920, "char_size": 13904}

{"text": "Over the last several years, scientists have grown increasingly alarmed about the depletion of groundwater in many parts of India. However, even in a country with severe, widespread looming water shortages, the case of North Gujarat stands out.\nFor more than three decades now, the farmers of North Gujarat have been productively utilizing the rich groundwater resources of the region in order to cultivate a variety of crops and a thriving dairy industry. The state of Gujarat (along with the Government of India) has also played its role in supporting this enterprise by providing these farmers with a variety of subsidized inputs, including reliable electricity for pumping groundwater as well as marketing and price supports.\nUnfortunately, because of the low levels of natural recharge of local aquifers, groundwater tables have fallen steadily throughout the same period. The groundwater situation is now so dire that the future of agriculture in North Gujarat is in jeopardy. Farmers are the first to suffer, as they must continually invest in deeper wells and more powerful pumps to irrigate, but nonetheless face a decline in both the quantity and quality of the water they are able to pump.\nThe effect of acute water shortages goes beyond immediate impacts on farmers. Under the current subsidy system, each year the government is forced to finance increasing amounts of expensive electricity for irrigation pumping, even as the benefit of pumping for farmers stagnates or declines as the amount of water available decreases. In addition, high consumption of electricity for irrigation puts pressure on the electrical grid and reduces available electricity for other sectors.\nFor the initial phase of its Gujarat project, the Columbia Water Center conducted an analysis of the water crisis in the Kukarwada sub-district in the Mehsana region. The study included a detailed survey of farmers and well operators in the region, along with an analysis of local hydrology, current energy policy and the potential for combining new incentive structures with water-saving technology to stabilize or reverse groundwater depletion in the region.\nThe study found that based on observation wells and farmer surveys, water tables in the study area have been falling steadily over the last 15-20 years, and have reached about 600ft below ground level, risking irreversible salinization of aquifers. The declining trend is seen in observation wells and confirmed by farmers\u2019 own recollection of water depth. The rate of decline is anywhere between 9 to 20 feet per year.\nTo deal with falling water tables, farmers need to continuously drill deeper wells and buy more powerful pumps. However, although the horsepower usage and the depth of wells have increased dramatically over time, an average well can now irrigate only about 60% of its command area during the or winter-crop season. Nearly all respondents expected the water table to continue its decline, and on an average expect water to last for about six years. Once that happens, more than half of farmers in the area plan to abandon irrigated agriculture.\nAt the same time, energy use appears to have increased over the last two decades without a matching increase in irrigated area. In other words, the \u201cdrop per unit of energy consumed\u201d continues to deteriorate, a situation that can is only made possible through large government subsidies. In fact, at depths from which groundwater is currently extracted, tubewell irrigated agriculture as practiced today is probably not financially viable.\nFinally, while the study indicated that there were a number of practices and technologies that could increase water and energy use efficiency, they are, with few exceptions, not adopted by farmers in in the study area. The main reasons for this, farmers said, was high cost, land fragmentation and lack of familiarity.\nBased on the results of this study, Columbia Water Center scientists began developing an approach to help farmers in the region save water. Given political and financial constraints, they determined that a successful approach would have to provide farmers both an incentive to apply water-saving approaches along with extension support to do so.\nIn partnership with the local electrical utility and the Gujarat government, the Center developed a pilot project that rewarded farmers by reducing the flat rate they paid for electricity for cutting water and energy consumption relative to a standard baseline based on historical use. As part of the project, farmers agreed to have their usage metered.\nGoals of the incentive program included, making the farmer direct beneficiary of reduced water use, providing information and measurement tool and ensuring that the project was revenue neutral for the government.\nFarm level GIS maps prepared that capture the land holding size, cropping pattern, area.\nTo date over 800 farmers have been enrolled. June of 2012 will mark the completion of the first year of field implementation, at which point the project will have documented the relative efficacy of various interventions as well as capturing behavioral changes through a new energy bill design to refine the incentive approach and scale up for subsequent years.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T14:20:01Z", "url": "http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/water-food-energy-nexus/water-agriculture-livelihood-security-in-india/gujarat-india/", "byte_size": 5239, "char_size": 5233}

{"text": "Bilberry, known to science as actinium myrtillus, is a member of the blueberry family, and it is known for producing sweet blue colored berries. The bilberry bush is found both in North America and Europe, and it grows best in damp, acidic soils. The blue to black bilberries are used for many medicinal purposes, while the leaves have additional healing properties.\nOne of the most significant properties of the bilberry is its ability to enhance night vision. From at least as far back as the sixteenth century, the bilberry was mixed with honey in order to create a syrup known as rob. This syrup was traditionally used to treat diarrhea, but today the fruits of the bilberry bush are being used to promote good vision, particularly night vision. In World War II, those pilots who ate large quantities of bilberries claimed to enjoy more accurate night vision, and many scientific studies have shown that bilberry is able to slow down the degeneration of sight, and may even improve visual acuity. In addition, bilberry has been used in traditional medicine for treatment of indigestion and diabetes, among other conditions.\nThe bilberry contains large numbers of phytochemicals, which are thought to help lower blood pressure, inhibit the formation of clots and enhance the supply of blood to the nervous system. Some studies have shown that the antioxidants found in the fruit of the bilberry bush are up to fifty times as powerful as vitamin E and ten times as powerful as vitamin C.\nBilberry also seems to show great effectiveness at reducing vascular insufficiency and other related conditions. Bilberry seems to work in much the same way as ginkgo biloba and horse chestnut, and the circulatory effects it produces are thought to be quite effective at increasing circulation and the health of the eyes and organs.\nBilberry can be consumed in several forms, including fresh bilberry, extract and capsule forms. When shopping for bilberry, either the fresh bilberry or the bilberry supplement, it is important to buy only the highest quality products.\nThe manner in which the fruit of the bilberry tree is harvested can make significant difference in its effectiveness as a health booster. It is important for the bilberry to be harvested at the peak of ripeness, and it is just as important that it be processed into supplements and capsules in facilities that use the best manufacturing equipment. Problems can be caused by contaminated manufacturing equipment, and buying bilberry from the most highly respected sources is the best way to ensure you get all the important benefits of the bilberry bush in your daily diet.\nThe bilberry, like the blueberry and other related berries, is among the best and highest quality foods on the market. Whether you buy your bilberry fresh at the supermarket or health food store, or opt for the stability and ease of bilberry supplements, it is important to incorporate this valuable food into a healthy diet, for the health of your eyes, circulatory system and nervous system.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T08:43:15Z", "url": "http://healthyeating.lifestylehealthy.com/articles/Bilberry--Health-Benefits.html", "byte_size": 3025, "char_size": 3025}
{"text": "Amy is on the Delectable Education Podcast today talking all about her vast experience with starting Charlotte Mason communities. Amy and I met largely because of the book club she held in her living room full of women eager to learn more of Mason, her methods, and how to better implement them in our homes. She also began a co-op out of her home which grew and grew until it became, and still is, a school for children K-12. After moving, she has begun a new co-op and still sits on the board at the school she began, though the running of the day to day operations is now in the hands of another amazing mother and teacher of Charlotte\u2019s method. In addition to books clubs, co-ops, and a school, Amy has also begun a Nature Club or two, muti-day summer intensives for mothers, field trips, and so many other ways that have helped moms and their children thrive not only in their homes, but within a community of learning.\nIf you are a reader who is clicking over after listening to the podcast, we welcome you to our little corner of the internet. We are homeschooling mothers who have used the CM method for many years and in many different situations \u2013 at home, in school, overseas, and in multiple regions within the USA. To hear more of our stories, click here. We like to write about how using the CM method has changed our whole lives, and not just our homeschools, so while we certainly write about nature, and books, and habits, you\u2019ll also see us chatting about homemaking, mother culture, and organizing our days.\nIf you are a long time reader, we invite you to head over to hear Amy speaking today on the podcast! We\u2019d love to hear about communities you\u2019ve started or questions you have about starting communities in the comments or via email.\nWelcome to the first room in our series, the Kitchen. Let\u2019s start here, as this is both the heart of the home and where much work of the mother occurs. Before we dive into cleaning, simplifying, and making our kitchen beautiful, it would make sense to think about what we need our kitchens to be. If we think of our rooms as servants to the people who use them, how can your kitchen better serve your family?\nThink through the annoying spots. That counter that is just NEVER clear, that drawer that doesn\u2019t even open all the way and you have no idea what is back there, the cabinet where all the storage containers are in a jumble or the pots are jammed in\u2026 You all know what your least favorite spots are. Write them down. If you use one, this would be a great page in your bullet journal. Write down all the things that make your kitchen inefficient or unpleasant right now. Some of these we can work on this month and it will be so nice to look at this list after the problems are solved!\nRelated to this is also the idea of where do your processes have a bottleneck? Is one part of the kitchen where people are bumping into one another as they cook while no one ever seems to be in another spot? Maybe some rearranging is in order. We\u2019ll discuss work zones later in the series, but it might be a good time to start thinking about yours and how you can arrange the things in your kitchen to accommodate the people who use them. In my home, I\u2019d like my kids to unload the dishwasher with less help from me, but that means it would be nice if all the bowls and glassware weren\u2019t on shelves they cannot reach. Perhaps moving the coffee maker and mugs away from the main cooking area to prevent morning traffic jams would help you, or creating a space where kids can help prep veggies without being too close to a hot oven is your need. Write down all your thoughts and possible solutions. Brainstorm here for a while because sometimes a very small change can have a big impact.\nWhen the cooking is through, is it easy to clean? Do you have a system for getting the dishes cleaned quickly after each meal and the counter cleared as well? Is the floor swept and the table wiped so that if a guest were to drop in, you could bring them gladly into your kitchen for a cup of tea or coffee? Do you have a schedule for cleaning out those things that are not everyday tasks \u2013 the oven, the microwave, the refrigerator? Cutting time off of your cleaning means you can use it elsewhere so we\u2019ll focus on this aspect of the kitchen too. Until then, write down a list of things that don\u2019t get done as often as you like, and another list of all the people in the home who are able to do those tasks. Caring for the home is a family affair, not yours alone.\nSwitching gears, what do you love about your kitchen? Maybe you appreciate the ample cabinet space, or you love an apron that was passed down from your grandmother. Big or small, make a list of things that are great about your space. Good light? Charming woodwork? A lovely piece of art hanging on the wall? We\u2019ll figure out a way to highlight these later and hopefully make the list even longer.\nLastly, I like to remember that when we make our space the best it can be, then it is up to us to improve our attitudes toward the space as well. I like to think of the fact that there are women who blog daily recipes and write cookbooks out of tiny kitchens. Ma Ingalls had no cabinets or refrigerator and she raised five children and cooked delicious meals. You need not live in or pine for some imaginary dream kitchen when the one you have now is where your life is being lived day by day. Amazing meals happen in awkward spaces and amazing memories are made in humble kitchens. Celebrate the space you have now, and let\u2019s make it as pleasant as possible.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T01:55:55Z", "url": "https://learninghowtolive.com/tag/homeschool/", "byte_size": 5591, "char_size": 5559}

And it\u2019s amazing to think how relatively young this technology is, considering its extraordinary role in changing how the world communicates.\nWe put \u201cinternet\u201d in quotes because what many people think of as the internet actually refers to a few different things. Often, people confuse \u201cWi-Fi\u201d with the internet, although Wi-Fi refers only to an internet connection being broadcast over radio waves.\nAnother term that gets mixed up with internet is \u201cWorld Wide Web,\u201d but really the World Wide Web (aka \u201cThe Web\u201d) is a global information system that operates over the internet \u2013 much as email or Skype or Netflix do. What makes the Web so interesting and important is that it essentially made the internet a more user-friendly place where people could easily share ideas, photos, baby videos \u2013 you name it.\nSince August 1 is World Wide Web Day, we thought we\u2019d take note of some of the facts and history behind the Web.\nThe invention of the World Wide Web is credited to an English software engineer named Tim Berners-Lee. The son of parents who were among the very first computer scientists, Berners-Lee was working at CERN \u2014 a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland in the 1980s \u2014when he became frustrated by the fact that information on computers was hard to share. Plus, the information was often in different computer languages. There had to be a better way.\nIf all of that sound mostly like gobbledygook to you, that\u2019s OK. The point is, it worked, and worked so well that by the time the mid 1990s rolled around, businesses started to get the point that they needed to be on the World Wide Web just to compete. Everyone else soon followed.\nAdaptation to the Web was aided by the fact that CERN agreed to make the underlying code for the Web available without any royalty fees \u2014 essentially opening up the Web to anyone and everyone and fueling the rapid growth of the internet, the World Wide Web and just about anything else you can think of that requires an online connection.\nDespite the seeming ubiquity of internet access, there are still billions of people around the world who don\u2019t have a connection \u2014 reliable or otherwise. That need is what\u2019s driven Viasat to advance the availability of internet over satellite. Where cables and terrestrial wireless can\u2019t or won\u2019t go, satellite will, and it\u2019s increasingly clear that satellite will be the technology to take the Web to many of the places it couldn\u2019t go before.\nIf you want to know more about the World Wide Web, check out the book \u201cWeaving the Web\u201d by Berners-Lee himself.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T17:58:14Z", "url": "https://corpblog.viasat.com/august-1-is-world-wide-web-day/", "byte_size": 2940, "char_size": 2882}

Namely, they feel bad about their own time management or they feel bad that they don\u2019t want to work as many hours as some business coaches say they need to.\nIn fact, in one case I heard of a business coach who suggested to a small business owner, with 3 small children, that if she wanted her business to work she\u2019d have to be working until at least 2 am every weeknight if she hoped to make a go of it. Not surprisingly this made the woman in question anxious and very upset.\nI also worked with a client who only wanted to work 3 days a week, but felt really guilty, as if this somehow made her less of a businesswoman.\nI say you have to create a business that suits you. Why leave the slaving away of the 9-5 to create a monster business that you have to feed, that wears you down and fills you with dread.\nYou get to create your own version of success.\nAnd while, of course, there is hard work involved, you get to choose how much you want to earn, how many hours you want to put in and generally build a business that fits around your needs.\nThere are times when I am awake at ridiculous times in the morning to get everything done, but there are also times when I\u2019m prancing around in the daytime at adult ballet classes or having tea with other amazing business women.\nOf course, we can\u2019t be crazy and expect to earn \u00a3100,000 if we only want to work a day a week. At least at the start anyway!\nSo I thought I\u2019d have a look around at what other people recommend around time and work.\nAnd here\u2019s some knowledge for you \u2013 in the UK we work more hours than anywhere else in Europe and we are also one of the least productive \u2013 so all those hours are definitely not turning into pounds.\nIn Alex Pang\u2019s book \u2018why you get more done when you work less\u2019 he points to a number of famous people who only worked 4 hours a day, including Charles Darwin, Thomas Jefferson, Alice Monro (who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2013) and French mathematician Henri Poincare.\nThey all certainly managed to get a lot done in those hours and didn't need to be burning the midnight oil to be successful.\nAnd science has proved it. Studies in the 1950\u2019s showed that scientists who spent 25 hours in the workplace where no more productive than those who spent 5. And those who worked more than 60 hours a week, where the least productive of all!\nNot quite sure yet about the 4-hour working day? What about 5 hours?\nA company in America decided to move to a 5-hour workday. All employees worked 8 am to 1 pm and got paid exactly the same.\nA year later they were the fastest growing company in San Diego, with their 9 person team making $9 million in revenue.\nSo working less made the team more productive, happier (as they got more time to pursue outside interests) and made them very successful.\nHow about a 3-day working week instead?\nResearchers in Australia looked at working hours for people in their middle ages. They found that anything over 25 hours a week resulted in fatigue and stress. And a recent study in the UK found that 1/3 of workers wasted around 3 hours every day because they weren\u2019t able to concentrate.\nSo the upshot of that is, if you work 25 hours over 3 days, you'll be more productive than working 7 or more hours a day for 5 days a week.\nOr what about a 4-hour working week!\nThe 4-hour Workweek by Timothy Ferris is a New York Times bestseller and claims to teach people how to escape the 9-5, live anywhere and get rich. That seems a little too farfetched for me, but I\u2019m sure it makes for interesting reading!\nHow can we grab this opportunity?\nIn reality what all of these studies and examples show us is that by concentrating our work into smaller blocks, we are more focused and less prone to distraction.\nIt also means that if we adopt a 4-hour day we\u2019re not going to feel guilty about going to a little adult ballet, a walk around the park, playing with the kids, baking cakes or whatever takes your fancy! We\u2019re going to be able to enjoy our time off a lot more. And we\u2019re going to be able to have more time, which is something most people feel they lack.\nObviously, sometimes we\u2019re going to have to work a little more if we have a deadline looming or we\u2019ve got a holiday coming up and need to crack on, but honestly, the extra stress might not be worth it!\nNext week I\u2019m going to be talking about tools and techniques you can use to manage your time better, so those 4 or 5 hours a day are really focussed, so that you really can create your dream business.\nSo next time you're cramming in your working day into a few hours so you can go and meet that friend, give yourself a pat on the back for being productive, rather than feeling guilty that you should be working!\nI\u2019m a coach supporting women in business make the most of their online marketing, so they can reach their ideal customers, make more money and build their dream business. There\u2019s no one sized fits all in life, there\u2019s you and your unique business!\nThinking of working with me? Why not take a look at what my past clients have to say!\nNewer PostSave yourself from Procrastination and manage your time!\nOlder PostWhat to do when Business feels like a Roller Coaster!", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T19:46:56Z", "url": "https://debbiedooodah.co.uk/blog/2017/12/14/the-secret-of-the-4-hour-working-day", "byte_size": 5300, "char_size": 5251}

{"text": "The interest in solar panels among home and building owners has noticeably increased in recent years, but uncertainty about costs, savings and the installation process have kept many from following through. Hoping to demystify the benefits of solar power, New York City launched a map that calculates the solar potential and annual savings of each of its more than 1 million buildings, according to a release. By typing in a building's address, users can discover how many pounds of greenhouse gases would leave the air as a result of installing solar panels on rooftops. In addition to calculating solar power's financial and environmental benefits, the website also offers clear, comprehensive information about the installation process, including what government incentives are available and how long before a building owner would regain the costs in energy savings. According to the New York Times, two-thirds of NYC buildings could be powered by solar energy, which could produce more than half of the city's electricity at peak periods. The map and its accompanying website were developed through partnerships between city agencies, an economic development corporation, and the City University of New York. It was financed by the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar America Cities program. San Francisco produced a similar map in 2007, which contributed to an over 400 percent rise in the number of solar panels on private roofs, reports the Times.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T06:27:36Z", "url": "https://www.governing.com/idea-center/Seeing-Solar-Energys-Impact-in-Numbers.html", "byte_size": 1452, "char_size": 1452}

The big game hunting license costs $164, and non-resident hog tags will cost somewhere between $72 to $75. If someone is fortunate enough to get an early season landowner elk tag and an early season landowner deer tag and then purchases several hog tags, they can take all three species on an August hunt.\nThe elk tag is the most difficult tag to draw because that tag is for hunting on the private land we manage. We have a long list of many people who want that August 1 elk tag, and drawing an elk tag through the open lottery is much like winning the Megabucks lottery.\nOne of the ways that many hunters acquire their elk tags is by going to a conservation organization\u2019s banquet and bidding on one of those tags that may go for $20,000 to $30,000.

{"text": "Q: What was it like growing up in the Dominican Republic?\nA: It was good for me because my mom and dad always took care of me. I started playing baseball when I was 9 or 10 and they took care of me. It was easy for me. I never had a job (laughs). The only thing I did was go to school and play baseball.\nThe starting pitcher talks about his hometown, his journey to the big leagues and his snappy fashion sense.\nQ: Is that still home for you?\nA: Yes, still. Every year I go back after the season. I stay there for four months and then come back for Spring Training.\nQ: Is it a lot different for you, going back? Are you a different person?\nA: No, it\u2019s the same. I have a lot of friends everywhere I go and I enjoy my time in the U.S., too.\nQ: What\u2019s your best baseball memory from the Dominican?\nA: The day I signed my first contract [with the Rangers] to be a professional baseball player. That was the most exciting moment of my life. You start playing at nine years old and you never think you\u2019re going to be a professional baseball player. It was my best moment. My mom and dad was there. They were more excited than even me. I jumped from being a little kid to being a professional player.\nQ: Not only did you become a professional baseball player, but now you\u2019re going to America and having to adjust to another country. How was that?\nA: It was hard for me a little bit because I had to learn English. I got lucky because all my roommates knew Spanish and English, so I learned how to speak a little bit. I remember one of my teammates, John Danks, he\u2019s a pitcher for the White Sox, and he was my roommate for four years in a row. He used to watch cartoons and I used to watch Telemundo. We made a rule -- he had to watch Telemundo for one hour, and I had to watch cartoons for an hour. It gave me a good example. Like a little kid growing up, you listen and listen and listen, and keep repeating, and it helped me a lot.\nQ: Besides the language, what was the biggest shock to you?\nA: Just being away from my family. I was excited to come to the States, but about two months later I just wanted to go back home. I missed everybody back in the Dominican. I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to stay playing because I wanted to see my family. I was sad a little bit. They didn\u2019t have a visa to come visit me.\nQ: Where most players\u2019 families come see their major league debut, you didn\u2019t have that, right?\nA: I remember in 2005 when I made my debut against the White Sox, I got a lot of support from the scouts and the guy who first signed me with Teas. He was there. He flew from the Dominican to Arlington to see me pitch.\nQ: You had a rough start with the Rangers, and you ended up going back down to Single-A and then working your way back up. Was that frustrating for you?\nA: It\u2019s like one of my friends says: \u201cSometimes you have to step back to go forward.\u201d At the time, I didn\u2019t understand, because if I play in the Big Leagues, why do I have to go all the way back to Single-A? Finally I did it and I did whatever they wanted me to do. I think it was better for me because I came back and won like 14 games in a row. It made me better. It made me a better person.\nQ: In 2008, you made the All-Star team with the Cincinnati Reds and in another game, went head-to-head with Cliff Lee and won. Did you realize how big that was?\nA: It was big-time. He was the leader in the American League and I was the leader in ERA, innings, strikeouts, everything. You don\u2019t see that too many times -- those pitchers from both leagues going against each other. The Reds gave me a lot of run support too (laughs).\nQ: I always see you by your locker, you have your headphones on, you\u2019re smiling, you\u2019re doing a little dancing. You like that, right?\nA: Yeah. I\u2019m a happy person and I like to enjoy everywhere I go. I like music, dancing, and I like to play around with my teammates, make them happy and give them support. When I went to Cincinnati, it was a happy clubhouse: \u201cWe lost today, but we\u2019re going to get it tomorrow.\u201d That\u2019s what I try to give those guys in there. If we lost today, there\u2019s nothing we can do. All we can do is get better and get ready for our next game.\nQ: You\u2019re a very snappy dresser, too. Where\u2019d you get your fashion sense?\nA: I don\u2019t know. I just know how to do it.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T18:20:52Z", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/padres/sdut-10-questions-edinson-volquez-2012jul28-story.html", "byte_size": 4328, "char_size": 4278}

She holds a firm belief that all houses should have flower boxes and that if it doesn\u2019t move, it should be monogrammed. Elle is married to her prince charming and is an obsessed Momma to their strawberry-blonde little girl, Emmy Lou. She designed their house in the country in 2015 and they live Southernly complete with a porch swing, donkeys in the backyard and toddler sized riding boots in the mudroom.

Jillian and Elle are sisters and you can often find them showing up to events in unplanned, matching outfits, and laughing as vendors confuse them with the other.\nthe start of a dream Elle has always had a passion for design and a strong work harder than you can dream ambition. She did not aspire to be a wedding planner and she actually never wanted to get married herself! It wasn\u2019t until she met her husband that she fell in love with love. Once her green eyed boy walked into her life, she knew she wanted to combine her love of beautiful spaces with her passion for romance and become a wedding planner. Elle spent countless hours of hard work doing hands-on industry & event research to find out what works and what doesn\u2019t, what a good planner should be and what tools they need. As she was creating EED, fellow planners asked her to help design their weddings; this lack of design in the wedding planning industry made her business plan a goal of combining the meticulousness of planning with the graceful art of design. With that, Elle Ellinghaus Designs began \u201cofficially\u201d in 2010 and has become a leader in the world of weddings. Elle was chosen for \u201cTop Ten\u201d in Baltimore Magazine, her work has been and continues to be featured in countless publications and she was invited to be a featured author in the Event Planning Major\u2019s textbook used in colleges nationwide.

A brand carried from the EED pink pineapple still focusing on high style planning, but for more petite soirees. She named EED producer, Chatara, as the lead designer and together they bring to life petite little parties.\nthankful Elle is so grateful and honored her dream that started with a sketchpad, blossomed into a wedding planning company that would be featured, have her designing in cities around the world and be asked to mentor others through workshops and speaking.

{"text": "As a healthy people in a healthy community, we no longer spend most of our time in the hospitals. Instead, we spend time on our small farms planting and harvesting our crops. We can put food on the table for our families.\nA year ago, generous donors helped rehabilitate a well with the Kimanget Community in Western Kenya. Because of these gifts and contributions from our monthly donors, partners can visit project sites throughout the year, strengthening relationships with communities and evaluating the actual water project. These consistent visits allow us to learn vital lessons and hear amazing stories \u2013 we\u2019re excited to share this one from our partner, Paul Weringa, with you.\nKimanget was like dozens of other Kenyan communities, facing waterborne diseases on a daily basis. They were drawing dirty water from an open well, and the community members did not know of treating water before drinking.\nRehabilitating the well by building a well pad and installing an AfriDev pump, and training the community members on good hygiene and sanitation has really improved health here.\nWithout having to face waterborne diseases, much has been achieved in terms of food production on their farms.\nWe met well caretaker Beatrice Naliaka to talk about how life has changed for her and her community over the past year. \u201cAs a healthy people in a healthy community, we no longer spend most of our time in the hospitals. Instead, we spend time on our small farms planting and harvesting our crops. We can put food on the table for our families.\nPaul stands with Eglay at her clean water source.\nThe only challenge here is that many people are still not willing to contribute fees for their well, which would be used for maintenance. They have the idea that water should be free, but the well is really providing a service that needs to be maintained to ensure sustainability. Our team continues to engage with them on this through our quarterly monitoring visits and other trainings.\nWhen you invest in The Water Project, you're investing in people like Beatrice Naliaka. Your gifts help us reach more communities with the gift of clean, safe water. And every drop helps unlock potential.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T07:57:33Z", "url": "https://thewaterproject.org/community/interest_story/a-year-later-kimanget-community", "byte_size": 2189, "char_size": 2183}

{"text": "A mosaic of hair-styles, colours, languages and blurry boundaries.\nThey were called Papua - \u2018frizzy-haired\u2019, by their western neighbours, the Malay-speaking people of Southeast Asia. This apt distinction and handy term was commonly adopted. The dark skinned, frizzy-haired people speaking Non-Austronesian (Papuan) languages made a distinctive group in Oceania. Or did they?\nThe picture is complicated since many frizzy-haired people in our region speak Austronesian \u2013 a family of languages with the largest geographical spread in the world in the pre-colonial era. This reflects past migration events, mixing traditions and formation of new cultures which historians, linguists and archaeologists attempt to reconstruct.\nThe complexity is well illustrated in East Timor where indigenous Papuan people speak Tetum \u2013 a language from the Malayo-Polynesian (Austronesian) family with some Portuguese influence, and another popular language - Fataluku - a Papuan (or more correctly Non-Austronesian) language, widely used in the eastern part of the country. Several smaller language groupings are also associated with Papuan language family. Bahasa and Portuguese were adopted in a more recent colonial period.\nEuropeans, often obsessed with skin colour, introduced the name Melanesia - meaning black, borrowed from Greek via French. It was coined by Jules Dumont d'Urville, French explorer, in 1832. He intended to define an ethnic and geographical grouping of islands whose inhabitants, he thought, were different from those of Polynesia and, of course, the most of Southeast Asia.\nBut Austronesian languages of the Malayo-Polynesian branch are spoken by inhabitants of Melanesia, including the Solomon Islands, Fiji and north eastern regions of Papua New Guinea such as Manus Island, New Britain, New Ireland and the Milne Bay area with hundreds of small islands. Scholars think this is a product of Austronesian people expanding east to the Pacific via Melanesia in prehistoric times, at least by the second millennium before the Common Era.\nOn their \u2018journey\u2019 future Polynesians picked up a bit of Melanesian pigment in their skin, but left a rich linguistic heritage and various cultural practices, including tattooing, head-hunting, making backcloth and outrigger canoes.\nHidden in the jungle and possibly in the deep shadows of the past are some little people. They are like Papuans, but very small, such as the Tapiro People in the Mimika River region of the Papua Province. Similar small people with frizzy hair and chocolate-coloured skin live, usually isolated, in remote locations across Southeast Asia \u2013 from Taiwan and the Philippines through to the Andaman Islands, and possibly even Australia.\nAccording to an old theory, these little people, sometimes called Negritos, may represent a remnant of original \u2018modern\u2019 humans in Southeast Asia and the first people ever who populated New Guinea and Australia a bit over 40,000 years ago. In recent times anthropologists eloquently dismissed this alluring theory, but the mystery of the little people still awaits explanation.\nIn commonly used geographical definition, Melanesia includes New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Bougainville, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji, where about 1000 languages are spoken. But Melanesian people are present in Southeast Asia as well, prominently in East Timor and Halmahera, making western boundary of Melanesia as blurry as the others.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T19:28:23Z", "url": "https://australianmuseum.net.au/blog-archive/science/our-global-neighbours-melanesia-a-birds-eye-view/", "byte_size": 3446, "char_size": 3428}

{"text": "Am I right in thinking that tickets booked as part of a holiday package from someone like Titan would be from a very cheap bucket?\nPackage holiday tickets cannot be upgraded full stop, irrespective of ticket flexibility.\nI booked Hong Kong Flights and Hotels via BAH and was still able to upgrade from CW to First one way, over the phone.\nRob \u2013 that is incorrect. I upgraded a package booking from Economy to Club Europe very recently via the BA Holidays call centre. It was booked in to N class initially.\nThe main issue with booking a package is that BA have removed (in the past year or so) the ability to see which fare class a flight is booked in to \u2013 unless you call them up and ask them before you book it\u2026.\nPerhaps the BA website works for direct flights but when there are connecting flights via LHR the \u201cupgrade using avios\u201d gives useless results.\nIf I search for HEL-LHR-KUL with \u201cupgrade using avios\u201d for May 2019 there is only availability about one day in seven. And the price is 66k avios + 8800e cash.\nIf I search for cash fares then EVERY DAY in May is available for a cash fare of 6500e (this is booking class A which is refundable and changeable for 150e fee).\nSo if you upgrade using avios you pay an extra 2300e cash plus 66k avios and severely limit your choice of flights??\nI don\u2019t know how the website can go so wrong. Even a fully flex J ticket is only 5600e so the 8800e cannot come from picking the highest price J ticket and upgrading to first with avios.\nO/T Anyone else having trouble logging into Iberia? I can log in via app and on mobile, but not on website and combine my avios.\nChanging browser to Firefox often works.\nI bought 1500 worth of Avois for \u00a365 and on top using my own Avois to make up 90000 for a redemption of \u00a3500. Was this wise?\nYou saved 0.55p per Avios spent. They\u2019re generally worth around 1p each as pointed out by Alex, but I tend to get at least 2p per Avios for my own use.\nIf there was literally nothing else you want to use them for then you could justify it as being wise, but I\u2019m confused when/why you bought 1500 of them for \u00a365? Those Avios only saved you around \u00a38.25 which is a huge loss. Though buying Avios for around 4.5p each is most likely never going to give you a return anyway.\nWell that\u2019s a bit better but still very poor value.\nThe most important question is whether YOU are happy with it though. I wouldn\u2019t consider redeeming my Avios for any less than 1p each (and think twice if it\u2019s less than 2p), but as long as you spent less than 0.55p each acquiring them and there was nothing more lucrative you could have used them for, it could make sense for you to do this.\nThanks for your comments \u2013 all but \u00a363 was through collection over the years ie. not paid for. This is my first time ever paying by Avios although I\u2019d tried several times to use them by upgrading but found them ridiculously expensive in addition to cash payment. At the end I redeemed it just so I could make use of it rather than just collecting.\nNo worries \u2013 that\u2019s a benefit often overlooked.\nWhile the value was poor, it sounds like your options were not use them at all or use them for this, which doesn\u2019t make it as bad as it initially seems!\nYou want to be aiming to get at least 1p per Avios in value.\nOfcourse \u00a3437 off is better than nothing but for c88.5k Avios you could\u2019ve done better.\nI\u2019m not sure about your spending or if you were travelling solo or with someone but \u00a310k spent on an AMEX BAPP gets you 41k avois and a 2 for 1 redemption voucher so 130k avois would\u2019ve got you a pair of CW redemptions to a lot of BA destinations.\nIf you can add a few clubcard points or an AMEX gold credit card application you could\u2019ve collected enough for 2 in First.\nThe surcharges and fees on redemptions can mean its not much cheaper than an two ex EU J tickets but then LHR is easier than AMS for some and less flying around if your companion isn\u2019t up for it.\nI just find that avios are hard to spend on flights when cash fares are available for prices in some casecjust double the avios fees. J fares ex the EU and increasingly thevUK can be had for \u00a31200 against BA fees of \u00a3598 for a redemption.\nI now only use BA when I can be sure I can get avios upgrade from crap world to J+ which makes using them bareable.\nYour second paragraph contradicts the first.\nYou mean like KLM in Amsterdam and Air France in Paris\u2026..no problem for me at all. Where can\u2019t you fly to from London ?\nIt seems IT (package deal) or BT (bulk or special fare) our organisation gets every time for ba flights from our travel agent are so rare they don\u2019t get mentioned in articles? They come in all fare (economy anyway) classes and stop upgrades.\nRob has explained them to me and I took it up with them but no joy.\nYour agent is ripping you off, end of story. Those tickets should only be sold as part of a package holiday.\nFor the record,anyone who uses the 40% off BA flights with Vitality\u2026 The class of the tickets does vary and is regularly a ticket class is the \u201cupgradeable\u201d list. However, under all circumstances it is not possible to upgrade using cash or avios. It says contact your travel agent, but of course these are a third-party who won\u2019t be able to help you individually.\nI would be interested to hear if anyone has ever found a way of upgrading asides from AUP.\nI was planning to cover Vitality tomorrow, spookily.\nI had similar experience last year booking with TrainFinders.\nBooking class N but still could not upgrade using Avios.\nBoth BA and TF kept passing buck.\nif you use avois to upgrade a cash booking to club europe (say), do you then also earn tier points as a club europe booking (i.e. 10 tier points becomes 40)? I\u2019ve done this a few times and seem to earn club europe tier points but on my last flight I didn\u2019t. Have I \u2018got lucky\u2019 via a glitch or was my last flight not credited correctly?\nShould be what you paid for.\nIs B class upgradable? I have B showing on one of my bookings.\nI may stand to be corrected, but I understand that B is \u201cFlexible Economy\u201d, so computer says Yes!\nThank you. I just saw that it was 20 TPs too. Hopefully something will open up.\nCan anyone post link to Avios distance based chart?\ni.e. the one which says zone 1 is 1-650 miles etc.\nIf I was willing to pay 1p per avios, any idea on how do I go about acquiring Avios quickly.\nNeed some for 241 redemption.\nIf you can wait a couple of weeks, then apply for a Platinum Amex and refer yourself and other half for bonus of 18k for every Amex referral that\u2019s accepted. Will have a short term negative effect on your credit rating mind.\nI need to buy something like 150K avios for two 241 vouchers to use.\nIsn\u2019t there now a 30 period before you can redeem the voucher?\nThanks. Thought they had scrapped that site to be honest.\nYou now have to manually enter your card number for every offer. And there is no way to tell which offers are saved on your card. Terrible system.\nThe saved offers still show on your Amex account with all your other saved offers.\nNot on MBNA or Lloyd\u2019s issued Amexes, unless they have recently fixed the website?\nO/T \u2013 anyone still waiting for SPG points to transfer over from their SPG card?\nWell partly, had a third transfer over last week but two thirds still in the Amex acc. which is a little confusing.\nYes, had 36,000 disappear from my SPG Amex account 3 days ago.

{"text": "My (Prospective) Tenant is on Life Support!\nI ran into a friend of mine recently who helps manage a very large portfolio of rental properties. She always has the funniest stories to tell, and I just had to pass this one on.\nThey had an ad running for a rental property in a nice area of town. It was a typical 3 bedroom bread and butter house and there had been a lot of interest on this particular property. She said that until just before closing, she had the usual run of the mill tenant applications.\nThen at the very last minute before closing, a lady ran into the office waving cash and said she had to put in her application today. She told the property manager that she was going to have to move quickly as she currently lived in a two story house with the bedrooms on the second floor. The applicant said this house was in the right location, and she reiterated that needed at least one first floor bedroom. She said this house would be perfect!\nThe prospective tenant began filling out the application and when it was complete my, friend looked over everything noting that the income given was for her and her husband. Wanting to get as much information as possible, she asked her why she needed to move so quickly. This nice lady said that, \u201cHer husband would be off life support any day now, and when he came home from the hospital he was going to need a first floor bedroom that would accommodate his hospital bed he would need for his long recovery\u201d.\nAfter my friend recovered from the shock of hearing he was currently in ICU on life support, she gently asked the applicant what she would do if by some chance he didn\u2019t recover. The tenant said she was sure he was going to recover but it might take some time. She just needed a house with a first floor bedroom. My friend pointed out that she didn\u2019t have sufficient income by herself to rent the property.\nSo how did they leave it?\nMy friend the property manager told her to see if she could find a co-signer and get back with her. She never heard back from the lady so we really don\u2019t know what happened.\nWow, that\u2019s a sad situation. But it makes sense that you need to rent to someone who can pay. I suspect she probably found another home to rent \u2013 hopefully it works out for her and her husband (and the landlord).\nI hope so too Mike. At the end of the day, you have to have a tenant that can pay the rent so that you can pay for the house. It would be much worse to let them move in (knowing that they couldn\u2019t pay) and then have to evict them. No one wants to do that.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T00:41:09Z", "url": "https://louisvillegalsrealestateblog.com/my-prospective-tenant-is-on-life-support/", "byte_size": 2556, "char_size": 2540}

{"text": "Hurricanes. Fires. Equipment failure. Theft. What would you do if your company\u2019s emails, billing records, customer files, inventory reports, payroll and tax information suddenly disappeared? If you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s time to create a disaster preparedness plan. Having a solid plan in place will help businesses minimize loss and disruption and return to normal operations as quickly as possible in the event of a disaster. This is especially critical for small businesses.\nWork with your team leaders (office managers, IT, security, sales, etc.) to create a detailed, written plan of action that makes sense for your company. Be sure the plan includes emergency contact information for your employees, vendors, etc. You\u2019ll also need to have a copy of your plan in a safe location outside the office.\nHow will everyone within your company communicate with one another in the face of a disaster? How will they ensure that everyone is safe and that each person is aware of his or her responsibility in helping to maintain operations? Hold a company-wide meeting in order to review your plan in detail. Ensure that all employees\u2014from the receptionist to the CEO and those that work part time or remotely\u2014receive both an electronic version and a printed copy. Any time the plan changes, be sure to let everyone know. As for new employees, the disaster recovery plan should be part of their initial employment training.\nObviously, preparation is critical for your internal team; however, your hardware, software, facilities, and service vendors are critical to your operations as well. Be sure you can get in touch with them\u2014chances are you\u2019ll need to. For example, what if you have products shipped to your office? Are your vendors willing and able to ship them elsewhere? Most likely, they will bend over backwards to assist you, but to do so, they must know the plan first.\nThe ability to communicate with employees and customers until your business is up and running is paramount to any disaster preparedness plan. Do you have another location where key employees can conduct critical business functions in the event of a disaster? Ideally, you would identify at least two separate locations, one of which is at least an hour away from your current location.\nDisasters tend to strike when they are least expected, instantly wiping out a significant amount of data. Small businesses say that data is their most valuable asset, but unfortunately, many small businesses only back up files once or twice a month, a procedure that can result in tremendous loss. Online backup is the best way to ensure you get all your files back easily in the event of a disaster.\nMake sure you find a service that works automatically and continually in the background. Doing so can do more than save you money; it can literally save your company. Look for a service that transmits your protected files offsite to secure severs to ensure your files safe from theft, fire, spills, power spikes, power outages, physical accidents and just about anything else that might happen in your office.\nThe internet is not always available. A good data backup service should be prepared to assist you if this is the case. Should you find yourself in this situation, you will want to have a service that can ship you a portable hard drive containing all of your backed up files. It\u2019s also critical that the service offers high-caliber customer support so that you can be walked through the process of recovering your files.\nWhat if your top executives are unreachable during the time of disaster? In addition to an offsite crisis meeting and work place(s) for employees, it is vital to select and train additional employees to perform emergency operations in their absence.\nPractice makes perfect. While it may generate some eye-rolling, companies that walk through a simulation have a far greater chance of successful recovery. Employees are less likely to panic when they are familiar with the plan. And even more importantly, a simulation allows flaws to be noticed\u2014and fixed\u2014before disaster strikes.\nThe plan outlined here is do-it-yourself, but it may make sense for you to bring on professionals for some elements, such as IT and security \u2013 and remember that Carbonite\u2019s SMB team is always available to small businesses as a resource. With affordable, annual pricing, Carbonite is friendly to your SMB budget.

{"text": "Music: The priority we live by, but can we afford to use by?\nMusic has been all around us and has made much of style since it\u2019s creation. The indigenous past time went through it\u2019s many incredible cycles. It started with the ominous and vintage vinyl player. That upgraded, eventually, to the casette player. And, as you can guess, that came to the Ipod. And, now the Ipod leads the world in music. But music costs money, and today\u2019s music producers deserve the right to automatically share with their listeners. But what makes this topic so debatable? The fact of the matter is that music producers and artists receiver more money and credit than their audience wishes to pay them. If you look at prices on Itunes, 1.99 may not seem bad for a song, but those prices add up, and as you slowly, or increasingly, make your way up to 100 songs, you\u2019ve wasted 200 bucks. Sorry cash that could have easily made it to a better purchase. Tax hikes recently on music have also brought me to this topic. This heated debate between the consumer and producer have given way to corruption as many fill their hands with more and more cash as prices for songs go up. Spotify recently was filed for tax hike by music producers. That is absolutely insane by my standards as I see paying for the service of listening to my favorite bands an outrage in itself. As a free member, I believe music should be free. The mass market of artists make high above normal, and don\u2019t need the extra green to live. So why price the music? The producers want to earn money, and to do that, they can\u2019t let people listen to the music. They want you to buy the music. Sure it may be their credit, but is a two minute song really worth spending on?\nI love coding and re-visioning the web. Designing it and redesigning it. Pixel by pixel. And technology and news rule my life. Check out my stories here and you shall truly see what I mean.\nFacebook\u2019s IPO: The Killer Company\u2019s Decision That\u2019s Killing Itself.\nI come from a position that once used to be a web for all to share. Copyright content was non talked about, until a resent tragedy that left us all nervous and wallowing in fear. This was the start of an evil opponent to the internet. Many of us take it in some views, and others in another perspective, but I believe this bill should be put to rest. The uprising of many protesters has not been pretty, and more may come if this demon of a bill breaks through this coming Tuesday.\nThis bill, proposed to pass, may, in fact, not be all that it says. It holds truth, also, to cutting off sites IMMEDIATELY. So, say you have a song, maybe on your site. It could be anything infringing. You may not know it, but Comcast could immediately take your site off their IPS. That is incredibly bad in a way that they can actually take you to court. This is an immediate threat that many of us on here have never come to. Having to pay to use pictures, video, or music? That\u2019s insane. Many of you, i\u2019m sure, have heard of Blogger. They\u2019re huge Google company, but SOPA could force them out of business. Blogs currently hosted on there have copyrighted content. So, Google and ISPs would block that. But, I know what you\u2019re thinking. What about my site? If it\u2019s on a domain name, you may be lucky to get the IP address in the box and head to the site while in affect.\nGlobal perspective could bring down the internet usage worldwide. And you may be wondering why? This is because foreign targets are suspected as copyright violators. While you may be able to view your site from that country, if you live there, and it contains copyrighted material, you won\u2019t see it here in the U.S. The bill also puts pressure on ads. Many companies rely on ads, Google being one of them. When ads are taken away, so is that company. And the fact that SOPA is doing this is not going to help anyone in this situation. The ads from the infringing site, global sites included, are found on Google now, they will no longer be found later. This is a big regime to keep the money coming to the media companies. Hey, my blog is awesome, let\u2019s put up an ad. Oh, wait. You have a photo, maybe from Engadget or Huffington Post, on your site. Now, your site is shut down, and no ad for you. This may infuriate users, but I see a globally hacking spree coming. Anonymous, the world-famous group, hacked a few sites recently in opposition of MegaUpload shutting down. FBI arrests of MegaUpload\u2019s founders were made, and not much good will come out. And censored search results will come into play. Money is lost and money is gained, and this will not be an easy task to tackle through.\nSOPA will also make building a startup harder. New regulations put into place will most likely bring less innovation. And less innovation almost falls to a monopoly, or oligarchy of the internet. These rules will weaken the internet indescribably. Say goodbye to Grooveshark and many other free services you use, as building another one will be made even more complicated than the first. Going through domain names is another subject. You may want to go foreign on domains, if SOPA passes, seeing as you may not have copyright issues there.\nMuch has gone through the past 4 months now. Fear and nervousness wretch through your bodies as you anxiously await the gruesome fate of the internet as it lies towards it\u2019s bed of disease. This never-ending virus will push you off from where you started. Anger and rage will soon flourish after this passes (hopefully not). Anonymous has helped by taking sites down today, and many others may be able to bypass SOPA. Other\u2019s will find it difficult and may give up. Vote No at AmericanCensorShip.org, and write to him today. Before the fate of the internet\u2019s hands is left beside the devil himself.\nThe season of giving has headed up so fast, you might not have felt the holidays until now. And the thoughts pile up.

For It\u2019s title, it has reached legendary status. 30 million copies sold and a game of never ending excitement has given the name Indie Game a new name. The popular title started off a mere 2 years ago. The game settled off Stockholm, Sweden, as these developers would release the next biggest Indie Game. Minecraft started as a world. Just a world. To create and edit unique buildings and shapes out of blocks. Updates were made, with many changes. They added day and night and new music. New blocks were also concealed in forthcoming packages. The ability to move blocks and items via redstone was also added. Pistons and coyotes. Ghasts of the underworld. Hundreds, if not more, items have been pushed through this immense process, until today. Minecraft 1.0 officially kicked off yesterday! But while that news may mean nothing, the game officially has no glitches or bugs. Continuous updates of the game will launch, as promised. But more to this package was added that made our mouths water. Minecraft: Pocket Edition. Now, Minecraft for the IOS and Android may seem difficult to play, but Mojang perfected the game, in classic mode, of how platformed-gaming should be done. The easy touch and break blocks and glitchless, for now, has gotten this game ranked #1 in the App Store, although not released until yesterday. With that being said, Minecraft is also launching\u2026for Xbox! That\u2019s right, and the interface seems outstanding.

Show times and tickets for Friday and Sunday performances and the Special Valentine's Eve performance - complete with a long-stemmed rose, chocolate and a gift for each member of the audience - can be found at Brown Paper Tickets.\n\u201cThe Fantasticks\u201d is a comical and romantic musical about a boy, a girl and their two parents who try to get them together by pretending to want to keep them apart.\nAs originally written, the play cast the respective fathers as the conniving parents. ACT 1 Theatre Productions Director Petra Karr has chosen to instead put the mothers into the story, a change previous directors of the play have made. While the lines in the play have not been altered, the dynamics of the story with two women delivering the lines is different. Karr made the change, in part, in order to take advantage of the way in which the two actors she cast as the mothers interact.\nThe narrator of the play, El Gallo, asks the audience to use their imagination and follow him into a world of moonlight and magic. The boy and the girl fall in love, grow apart and find their way back to each other after realizing the truth in El Gallo's words: \"Without a hurt, the heart is hollow.\"\n\u201cThe Fantasicks\u201d is the longest running off/on Broadway musical in history. The book and lyrics were written by Tom Jones and the music composed by Harvey Schmidt.\nACT 1 is donating 100 tickets per Des Moines performance to Wesley Homes\u2019 residents and encourages guests to purchase tickets early. Seating is limited.\nFor additional show times and locations or to find out more about ACT 1, please visit their website. All proceeds go to ACT 1 Theatre Productions.\nWith more than 50 combined years of regional and educational theatre experience under their belts, Christopher and Petra Karr officially launched ACT 1 Theatre Productions in 2008. In 2012, the theatre company became a non-profit organization. Though ACT 1 takes its act on the road, all of its major productions are done in the studio in Sumner, Washington.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T19:54:33Z", "url": "https://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/01/prweb13187447.htm", "byte_size": 2357, "char_size": 2341}

{"text": "One of the hardest tasks as a marketing manager is encouraging your team to be at the top of their game for as long as humanly possible.\nThe challenge lies in the fact no one can be one-hundred-percent \u2018on it\u2019 all the time. We all have our off days, and sometimes a bit of R&R or a lighter workload is vitally important.\nWhat should be consistent, however, is the ability to be proactive.\nIf your marketing team feels more reactive than proactive, here\u2019s some simple tips to turn them around.\nYou\u2019re not running a dictatorship, but as the leader of the team, you do need to be honest and offer constructive feedback.\nIf the team isn\u2019t being proactive enough, tell them. You don\u2019t need to call a summit or hold intense one-on-ones with them, either. Do it as part of your weekly meeting or just an off-the-cuff chat in the office one day.\nUgh \u2013 there\u2019s nothing worse as an employee than having a manager who constantly micromanages everything you do.\nYou might feel like you\u2019re doing the business and the employee a favour by keeping an ever watchful eye on their every movement, but in reality, you\u2019ll simply be doing a lot of the legwork for them and they won\u2019t have any inclination to be proactive.\nBack off a bit and let the team members get on with their own jobs. They know what they\u2019re doing, and then more space and trust you give them, the more likely they are to forge ahead on their own path.\nA big issue with team members becoming more reactive than proactive often lies in the manager believing that they always know best.\nThis results in projects being delivered dictatorially and no one else\u2019s voice being heard. Just like micromanagement, this will push more people away than it engages; why should you be proactive if your manager seems intent on making every single decision for you?\nTo have the impetus to be proactive, we all need to feel like we\u2019re a key stakeholder in whatever it is we\u2019re doing. It needs to feel like ours, albeit for a greater good (the business itself).\nWith that in mind, make sure everyone in the team is a key stakeholder in something. It might simply be a component part of a marketing campaign or an entire marketing campaign itself \u2013 depending on their experience and level of responsibility, choose something that will make them feel proud to come to work each day.\nDoes your marketing team regularly grapple with problems? If so, they probably need to become more solution oriented.\nProblems arise all the time in marketing, but if the team starts viewing them as challenges that can be overcome, they\u2019ll quickly get over any initial frustration and start proactively looking for a solution.\nLike anything in leadership, if you start at the top, you\u2019ll find the ways you work and carry yourself through the working week will gradually trickle down through the ranks.\nAre you proactive enough? The tips above can \u2013 and should \u2013 apply to everything you do yourself. Start there if you have suspicions about how reactive you can be!", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T17:58:19Z", "url": "http://www.businessfiction.co.uk/2018/11/how-to-turn-a-marketing-team-from-reactive-to-proactive/", "byte_size": 3018, "char_size": 2978}

{"text": "Competition policy, as we now know it, is a relatively recent phenomenon in some Latin American countries, not so new in others, and non-existent in an ever smaller group. The issue of antiquity is illustrative of the context in which enforcement authorities and the courts interact with each other. It can affect the degree to which they are influenced by older regimes and also tell us something about the path of institutional strengthening that every authority undergoes. In other words, one would expect that long-standing competition authorities face different challenges than their younger counterparts.\nBecause the post was turning into a lengthy document, I will divide it in two parts. Part I deals with North and Central America and the Caribbean, and part II will present the information corresponding to South America. The latter will be published in one-week time.\nThe year in which I consider that a modern competition policy began in each Latin American country is presented. The starting date is counted from when a competition authority started to exist, who is in charge of enforcing an antitrust law applicable on an economy-wide basis, as opposed to sectoral regulation of competition. Exclusively criminal liability statutes are excluded since experience has shown they were seldom enforced and, therefore, cannot be counted as a policy apt to deter anticompetitive behavior. For the same reasons, in some cases I do not start counting from the year of the country\u2019s first economy-wide competition law if they were either not enforced or done so in procedures without the expectation of a dissuasive penalty. More details will be presented as each country is analyzed.\nMexico\u2019s first competition law entered into force in June 1993, and created the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Competencia. It is hard to find the exact month when the institution started to operate. According to the first annual report, merger control activity and the prosecution of anticompetitive behavior started during the second half of 1993. Therefore, that year is set as the starting date of modern competition policy in Mexico.\nGuatemala is one of two countries in Latin America that still does not have an economy-wide competition law.\nEl Salvador\u2019s first competition law entered into force in January of 2006, date in which the antitrust authority, Superintendencia de Competencia, started to operate.\nHonduras\u2019s first competition law entered into force in February 2006 but it was not until December of that year that the Comisi\u00f3n para la Defensa y Promoci\u00f3n de la Competencia started to operate.\nNicaragua\u2019s first competition law came into force in June 2007, but it was not until March 2009 that the first authorities were elected and started to hire the authority\u2019s first team of professionals. Therefore, the latter date is set as the beginning of competition policy in Nicaragua.\nAccording to the OECD peer review of competition policy in Costa Rica, the Comisi\u00f3n para Promover la Competencia started to function in 1996 (OECD (2014, p. 7)). However, the same report states that the first cases decided by the authority date back to 1995 (Id., p. 28 & 34). The authority\u2019s website shows the same information of a cartel and an abuse of dominance case that were resolved in 1995. It appears that the OECD 1996 date may have been a mistake and that the real year in which the antitrust law began to be enforced was 1995.\nPanama\u2019s first competition law was enacted in February of 1996, but according to the OECD peer review, the antitrust authority received its first endowment in 1997 (OECD (2010a, p. 57)). Indeed, 1997 is the first year in which the Comisi\u00f3n de Libre Competencia y Asuntos del Consumidor reports activity.\nHaiti is the other one of the two Latin American countries that does not have a competition law.\nThe table below presents a summary of the information.\nTo conclude, it is worth noting that Mexico\u2019s policy is the oldest from the countries under analysis. In Central America one can distinguish two waves of adoption of competition policy, with Costa Rica and Panama as the pioneers. The rest of Central America caught up some 11 to 14 years later with the exception of Guatemala, who under the Association Agreement with the European Union has the obligation to pass a competition law by the end of November of 2016. The two sovereign Latin-Caribbean states lack competition policies as well, though the Dominican Republic is just a few steps away.\nReblogged this on Derecho y Pol\u00edtica de Libre Competencia en Am\u00e9rica Latina.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T03:10:26Z", "url": "https://developingworldantitrust.com/2015/06/29/the-adoption-of-modern-competition-policies-in-latin-america-part-i-north-and-central-america-and-the-caribbean/", "byte_size": 4571, "char_size": 4546}

However, I highly doubt Atlus is as protective of its music as Square is and the press release posted by Nintendo alongside Joker's reveal specifically called out the SMT series as a whole, so fingers crossed I guess.\nedit: Speaking of which, if Jack Frost is part of Joker's moveset I really hope there's a pallete that makes Jack look Virtual Boy inspired.\nBayo is listed as Bayonetta 2 on the website, so there\u2019s hope.\nI'm assuming it's to make him more different than he would be, or perhaps he uses the knife backhand in the anime. It could also be related to one of the new games, or \"Jane\".\nEDIT: I mean reverse grip.\nYeah the stance is weird, especially when he never ever holds his knife backwards in P5.\nI'm not talking about website listings.\nBayonetta didn't even get one in her trailer.\nMaybe his hand is upside down.\nI like how they didn't specify Street Fighter II but excluded everything else anyway.\nI'm hoping for school clothes and/or casual clothes. I played most of Persona 5 wearing those outfits instead of the phantom thief outfit. Joker looks cool in glasses!\nWill be a shame when I inevitably can't Smash as Santa.\nMaybe he'll get this as an alt colour. Just won't have the hat.\nExclude Morgana and Futaba and that leaves enough boy thieves and girl thieves for Jack and Jane to reference.\nThere's a 100% chance that Joker's trailer will feature a quick clip of him and Richter adjusting their gloves together, right?\nSakurai has been spoiling plot twists with every smash game. Mecha Fiora is in Shulk\u2019s FS.\nAnd Sheik in Melee. I don't think they really care.\nBased on color scheme and my P5 party, I want Yusuke and Haru alts. Makoto was my other, but less interesting color-wise.\nRemember when sakurai made a post brawl blog post explaining the plot of subspace.\nNintendo being all innovative again. Having story based DLC before they even had DLC!!!\nThen it wouldn't be nearly as funny.\nDo people still complain about online?\nI can\u2019t even remember the last time I got in a match that wasn\u2019t my preferred rules, or at least either battlefield or FD.\nAt this point, I see the 3.0 update just dropping with little fanfare. One where you'll just have to try out the new stuff yourself instead of having it all shown to you. They really blew it by having absolutely nothing meaningful to say about the 3.0 update or Joker since the last big update.\nI got a Little Mac on Pac-Land with items in Elite Smash.\nI get my fair share of item matches and non-BF/FD still.\nYou guys buckle way too easily. They teased more info in the February Direct and said \u201cbefore the end of April.\u201d There\u2019s also the Persona concert that we might have to wait to see Jane first revealed.\nNintendo knows people go nuts for Smash info, they aren\u2019t gonna undersell it. Sakurai spent 20 minutes talking about menus and languages but isn\u2019t going to talk about Persona content or Stage Builder?\nI was there then pointed in this direction so guess I'm here now.\nBut it wouldn't fix the fact that it's laggy nonsense most of the time.\nI guess I\u2019m just lucky. I never get matches with bad rule sets.\nThat leak\u2019s interesting. Hope that it\u2019s right about franchise elements being included in stage builder. Each major franchise as its own palette a la Mario Maker?\nThey really do need to have a way to share stages online though, it would be a weird downgrade from Wii U. And I\u2019m also hoping for a Mii costume set that includes some of my favorites from Smash 4 like Geno and Protoman.\nHe\u2019ll have at least one color based on Crow if nothing else. I\u2019m confidant of that. I would love full alts just because there are some great choices.\nOther than getting a Smash ball battle today I\u2019ve gotten my preferences nearly every time.\nIs that Ren as Kiryu?\nThe dancing game had a few crossover costumes.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T16:33:08Z", "url": "https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-smash-bros-ultimate-downloadable-contents-discussion-thread-the-wild-ride-is-still-on.91979/page-276", "byte_size": 5942, "char_size": 5900}

{"text": "** We'll never share your email address and you can opt out at any time, we promise.\nAn interview with Jon \u201cBernie\u201d Bernstein, Director of Digital Marketing, Fifth Story.\nQ. Bernie, can you tell us when and why you would use paid video to build remarketing audiences?\nA. In case you are not familiar with remarketing, it is a way to connect with people who previously interacted with your website or mobile app. It allows you to strategically position or leverage your ads in front of these audiences as they browse Google or its partner websites, thus helping you increase your brand awareness or remind those audiences to make a purchase.\nFor some brands that are trying to find that \u201cneedle in a haystack\u201d audience or an expensive-to-reach audience (like when there is lots of competition and many companies are bidding), using YouTube video pre-roll can help to define and build a remarketing audience in a cost-effective way and narrow down a hard-to-reach target.\nQ. Can you give an example of this?\nA. Sure. For example, if a drywall manufacturer/seller were trying to reach small-to mid-sized contractors and homeowner DIYers, we would run a targeted pre-roll video campaign on YouTube with specific parameters such as demographics, geo-targets, and interests in home, plus add in keywords such as home renovation, home building, etc. We would also run the video pre-roll within content-rich related environments, such as how to install drywall, basement renovations, and other similar content topics that would fit. The pre-roll for the drywall brand would run before the install/reno video content (usually longer-form YouTube content).\nBy selecting this type of target audience and content environment, we can reach an engaged, active audience that is looking to install the product or do similar reno work that could lead to drywall installation at a reasonably low cost per view.\nFor each viewer who watches the pre-roll for 10 seconds or more, we can add them to an audience remarketing list. This helps us develop a targeted list of people who have already shown interest in the product and engaged with the brand. Now we have a more niche marketing list of engaged people that can be reached at a lower cost. This is much more effective than a straight search campaign where you can reach engaged people, but at a high cost. Also, when people click on a remarketing ad, they are more likely to spend a good amount of time on the site since they have some familiarity with the brand/product by watching the video.\nQ. What length of pre-roll would you run to build your remarketing list?\nA. If the video is really informative and it relates to the subject matter of the main video content (what plays after the pre-roll), you can run a longer video. For example, a home building/renovation client ran a video as pre-roll about their home renovation product. The video targeted people who were interested in the renovation category. The average watch time was 1:14 minutes out of a 1:32-minute long video. That is an 86% average video watch time on a video people could have skipped after 6 seconds.\nQ. Do you have any content or creative must-haves for pre-roll video?\nThe other must-have is a call-to-action to click on a website or call (on mobile) to get more information. They may not click if they really wanted to see the video after the pre-roll, but if you have pulled them in enough, you may get them to take action \u2014 if not now, at a later time.\nQ. Can you explain a bit about cross-platform remarketing?\nA. Once you build a remarketing list using YouTube, you can remarket to this audience using YouTube again with additional or sequential video content, or you can remarket to them using Google Display or Search Ads. The purpose of remarketing is to drive a specific audience back to your site to take action.\nIf you set up pixels from other platforms, such as LinkedIn or Facebook, you can also remarket to individuals on these platforms. For example, if you developed a broader remarketing list from YouTube of people who subsequently visited your website from a click on the video or a targeted remarketing ad, that will then trigger the LinkedIn Insight Pixel to fire. With this, you can then narrow the audience on LinkedIn down to profession, job title or association. This dramatically enables B2B marketers to reach very specific targets that are either impossible to get to directly or incredibly costly to reach.\nTo learn more about remarketing, please visit this blog post.\nFifth Story, 5th Story, News Canada, L'edition Nouvelles and News North America are either registered trademarks or trademarks of News Canada Inc.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T04:48:47Z", "url": "https://fifthstory.com/leveraging-paid-video-for-remarketing/", "byte_size": 4668, "char_size": 4658}

{"text": "There are a few things we should demand from a decent power supply. Not least, it shouldn't require oven-like temperatures to function. That's just a given.\n\"Fluoride batteries can have a higher energy density, which means that they may last longer \u2013 up to eight times longer than batteries in use today,\" says Caltech researcher Robert Grubbs, famous for winning a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2005.\nThe type of electrochemical technology supplying power to your smart devices makes use of positively charged lithium 'Li2+' cations as a kind of chemical 'piston' to draw an electrical charge through a circuit.\nAt full charge, a supply of cations occupy the battery's anode. Once the circuit is closed, ions surge into the cathode, producing a current that does the all-important work. To reset the cell, all that's required is a voltage to 'push' the lithium piston back again.\n\"For a battery that lasts longer, you need to move a greater number of charges,\" says Simon Jones, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\"Moving multiply-charged metal cations is difficult, but a similar result can be achieved by moving several singly-charged anions, which travel with comparative ease.\"\n\"But fluoride can be challenging to work with, in particular because it's so corrosive and reactive,\" says Grubbs.\nThis isn't to say nobody has successfully made a functional fluoride ion battery. But the ions are part of a solid structure, which as you can imagine doesn't let them slip around too easily. Not at room temperature at least.\nOn finding the solvent did a fairly suitable job of allowing fluoride's anions to shuffle between electrodes at room temperature, the team ran models to find ways to tweak its performance with additives.\n\"We are still in the early stages of development, but this is the first rechargeable fluoride battery that works at room temperature,\" says Jones.\nSo, we might need to wait a bit longer for weekly phone recharges, but this is an exciting step - an we can hardly wait for this exciting technology to come into the market.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T20:33:26Z", "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-negative-rechargeable-battery-could-keep-your-laptop-running-for-weeks", "byte_size": 2063, "char_size": 2061}
{"text": "All Bryan Singer films are deeply unsure of themselves: they attempt to marry several conflicting elements while never quite deciding what they want to be. Superman Returns can't decide whether it wants to be dark and moody like Batman Begins or a nostalgic throwback to the earlier films. Valkyrie flits between a romping B-movie about Tom Cruise blowing up Hitler and an intense character study about what it means to betray your country. And then there is The Usual Suspects, which claims to be the heist movie with the ultimate twist, but ends up as the ultimate disappointment. When making a genre film or any kind of homage, there is a very fine line between playing with conventions and coming across as completely unoriginal. The ingredients of a heist film are among the most familiar and formulaic in cinema: the assembly of a team, typically for one last job, the heist being planned and executed, and then something going horribly wrong. One of the tests of a good filmmaker is being able to take a very clich\u00e9-ridden subject and do something interesting and memorable while being fully mindful of generic constraints. There are two main ways to make a good heist film in the modern day. The first is to take a particular convention and break it. In The Ladykillers, the heist is barely planned and takes place off screen, with the majority of the film being focussed on the gang unravelling at the hands of Mrs. Wilberforce. The second is to use audience familiarity with conventions to one's advantage, using the heist as a springboard to explore something else. Inception may have a heist structure, but the actual crime which Cobb commits is only as important as the ideas surrounding it - the nature of dreaming, the fracturing of identity, the consequences of addiction and the pain of losing one's love.\nFrom a purely mechanical point of view, The Usual Suspects is a very well-made heist film. All the pieces of the plot fit together very well: there are no gaping holes in either Kevin Spacey's account or the various encounters which persuade Gabriel Byrne to come on board for the big job. And taken in abstract, the final twist is fairly impressive. It's not a million miles away from the silly ending of Shattered, but it's carried with suitable grace and doesn't feel like an unnecessary contrivance, crowbarred in to bring the film to a speedy conclusion. But here, already, we have the central problem with the film. The Usual Suspects may be mechanically sound, but it is so obsessed with being mechanically sound that it never allows you to bond with what is going on in the meantime. Singer spends so much time and effort ensuring that we go through the motions in the slickest way possible, that the actual characters become increasingly superfluous.\nBy keeping the characters at arms' length from the plot, a barrier between the story and the audience is created. Whenever the screenplay attempts to invoke ideas about the nature of evil, or fear, or the power of will, these ideas are quickly passed over or shot down as the film demands to keep pressing forward. Potentially fascinating explorations of the nature of underground crime are suppressed in favour of the next irrelevant plot point, making The Usual Suspects a decidedly hollow experience. If we compare Singer's efforts to that of Quentin Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs, the significance of this problem becomes apparent. Like The Usual Suspects, Reservoir Dogs is a straightforward heist film whose distinctions are structural rather than aesthetic. But unlike Singer, Tarantino's work not only knew its place within a genre: it knew that the audience knew its place as well. By giving the audience a degree of certainty, Tarantino could get away with his outlandish dialogue and shuffled timeframes which would otherwise have thrown the audience a bigger curveball. To use the analogy of a circus, Reservoir Dogs is like a show at the big top in which everything happens as expected, but always with a flourish. Instead of just a trapeze act, we get a trapeze artist doing triple somersaults - and instead of gangsters simply talking about the heist, we get them to dissect the meaning of Madonna's 'Like A Virgin'. The Usual Suspects is like a circus show in which the ringmaster is so keen to hurry the acts along that we have no time to admire them, and all that is memorable is the huge poles holding up the tent. You only have to look at the characters to realise how much talent has been squandered here. The five 'usual suspects' are all quirkily drawn, whether in their dress sense, their accents or the way they conduct themselves within the group. Christopher McQuarrie's screenplay contains a number of potentially great scenes, laden with distinctively macho dialogue and criminal posturing. But the more time we spend in their company, the more you come to realise that they are quirky for its own sake: there is no narrative reason for Benicio Del Toro to speak like that. They are little more than archetypes in new suits, and like later Tarantino works, you are never convinced that any of them could really exist.\nWithout properly three-dimensional or believable characters, or much direction beyond rigidly following a formula, the one thing that could have saved The Usual Suspects would have been some kind of moral clout. Both this film and Se7en are thrillers in which the villain is prominent, or at least has a prominent presence which hangs over everything that unfolds. But what made Se7en work, aside from David Fincher's distinctive visuals, was its ability to make subtle contemporary moral points while honouring an old-fashioned hardboiled storyline. The Usual Suspects has the potential - that word again - to have this exact kind of moral clout. The character of Keyser Soze, a criminal who operates underground through oblivious associates, is an intriguing creation which carries meaning about the way that evil infiltrates society. Kevin Spacey's long monologues contain references to the Devil and vengeance on a genuinely Biblical scale, painting Soze as a man that would make even Hannibal Lector flinch. But again, the film never allows these ideas to come out beyond brief suggestions - suggestions which are barely elaborated upon by either the story or the characters. In the midst of all this, The Usual Suspects deserves some credit for its execution. Singer is not a terrible director, at least not from a constructional point of view: his camerawork is solid and the heist scenes especially are well-shot by his long-time cinematographer, Newton Thomas Sigel. As far as the performances go, Kevin Spacey gives his all in the meatiest of roles; his performance of a man with cerebral palsy is Oscar-baiting but convincing. Gabriel Byrne remains an enjoyable screen presence, even if his choice of films is somewhat less enjoyable, and it remains the best thing that Stephen Baldwin has ever done. But in all, The Usual Suspects is a densely plotted disappointment. Singer can never make up his mind what issues he wishes to explore within the confines of the story, and the result is a film which claims a lot but delivers on very little. Through the best efforts of the performers and the decent visuals, you find yourself wanting to like it more, and you start looking for something or someone with whom you can engage. But for all your best efforts the film never lets you in, making The Usual Suspects little more than a well-made waste of time.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T16:41:04Z", "url": "http://threemenonablog.blogspot.com/2011/03/film-review-usual-suspects-1995.html", "byte_size": 7493, "char_size": 7492}

{"text": "A Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 Review \u2013 Where Is Walter Jones?\nPENCILLERS: Thony Silas, Corin Howell. Cover by Jamal Campbell.\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 tells us that before Tommy became Rita Repulsa\u2019s evil Green Ranger, she made a play for Zack, the Black Ranger. After being \u201cupstaged\u201d by Jason during a fight, Goldar and the putties abduct Zack so Rita can make her pitch. Obviously, Zack doesn\u2019t accept. But how do the events of this issue impact Zack\u2019s relationship to the team? And what happens when Zack tells Zordon?\nRita tempting one of the Rangers toward the dark side is such a simple, classic tale. It\u2019s perfect for this series. I\u2019m not sure I wouldn\u2019t have gone with Billy instead of Zack, especially considering the scene we saw in issue #2. He was comparing himself to the others, and he seemed to become self conscious and bitter. If Rita could have seen that, she might have exploited it. On the other hand, we\u2019ve seen some curious behavior from Zack in this series. He\u2019s been very suspicious and apprehensive about Tommy. This issue seems to explain why. This experience gives him a negative connection to the Green Ranger that we never knew about.\nThe Zack we\u2019ve seen in this series isn\u2019t the one I expected. On the show, Walter Jones played a fun-loving dancer. Zack is in love with life, and he\u2019s not afraid to show it. That\u2019s not the character we\u2019ve seen in this series. For the most part he\u2019s been very straight faced. I understand he\u2019s in a very tense storyline. But flashes of personality aren\u2019t going to hurt anything, are they?\nIn essence, what we need in this book is a little more Walter Jones.\nFussy Fanboy Moment: After Zack is abducted, he wakes up in Rita\u2019s Dark Dimension, which we saw in the show. But in one of the \u201cGreen Candle\u201d episodes, which these events obviously predate, Jason says he and Tommy are the only Rangers that have been there.\nOn the plus side, Higgins sneaks in what seems to be a hint at Zack going to the Peace Conference later in the series. He tells Zordon, \u201cI need to do more \u2026 I don\u2019t care about leading. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d I like that second line. It speaks to why Rita\u2019s plan for Zack doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s imperfect like anyone else, but in the end he\u2019s selfless. It\u2019s more about the good that\u2019s being done, as opposed to the glory you get from it.\nThe opening sequence, set in Italy, is a lot of fun. The Rangers face Rita\u2019s monstrous take on The Vitruvian Man, who can apparently only speak in da Vinci quotes. Afterward, they receive some fanfare on the ground. We even have the prime minister in the middle of the action. This is yet another example of Higgins doing something that never could have happened on the show.\nThony Silas tags in on pencils for this issue. His style isn\u2019t dramatically different from Hendry Prasetya\u2019s, though his characters are slightly better at emoting. His Rita is particularly sinister. Again, his Zack seems very reserved and stoic, which is not the character we\u2019re used to.\n\u201cThe Ongoing Adventures of Bulk & Skull\u201d still doesn\u2019t do much for me. Though we do get a surprise in this issue: The BOOM! Studios debut of Lieutenant Stone, Bulk & Skull\u2019s foil from seasons 3 and 4. I\u2019d always been under the impression they\u2019d never met before. Either way, I\u2019m glad to see the putty patroller story is over. On to (hopefully) better things.\nHiggins pleasantly surprised me with this Zack story, by following up on a plot seed he\u2019d planted as far back as issue #1. It makes you wonder what else he might come back to in future issues. Whether it\u2019s how Billy sees his role on the team, Jason feeling threatened by Tommy, or something else fans may have wondered about. There\u2019s so much fertile ground to cover, and I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface.\nThis entry was posted in Comic Books/Graphic Novels and tagged Billy Cranston, Black Ranger, BOOM!

{"text": "The premise of this blog is fairly simple, and it should be available to anyone who really thinks and cares about education. We will look at some of the big stories in the world of education\u2013primarily American public education, but not exclusively\u2013and any opinions, advocacy or potential reforms will be couched in an explanation of how it relates to the purpose and nature of education. Each post here, going forward, will include something about what education is.\nThere are two important takeaways from this story. First, the federal government this year increased spending on higher education, which made a big difference in the bottom line for students. The second major point from the report, a point which wasn\u2019t made in the Times article, is that the rising tuition accompanied by increasing aid is a large stride towards making higher education funding more equitable. Students who come from money end up paying the full sticker price for college, while students with significant need receive the lion\u2019s share of this aid, lowering their total expenditures and improving the socioeconomic diversity of universities.\nThis second point is where I want to focus. Education Is\u2026 about leveling the playing field and offering equal opportunity to all. This change, where total tuition increases alongside major increases in financial aid, will contribute significantly to equity in higher education. For me, education really is all about equity and equal opportunity, and in the past, colleges and universities have been some of the most unequal places in American society, often contributing significantly to the perpetuation of social and economic inequality. Anything that makes a push towards greater equality is meaningful precisely because it goes to the root of what education is; and in my mind, education is and must be an engine for equality. Indeed, the American Dream is based upon the idea (some would say myth) of educational equality, and if we believe in the idea of American exceptionalism and a meritocratic system, it is our duty as citizens and as a country to strive for as much equality of opportunity as possible.\nThat\u2019s not so complicated, now is it?", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T00:16:13Z", "url": "https://educationnew.wordpress.com/tag/financial-aid/", "byte_size": 2189, "char_size": 2177}
{"text": "Pesky allergies \u2013 itchy and watery eyes, sneezing, fatigue \u2013 can completely ruin your day, week or month. Seasonal allergies affect 1 in 5 people; the numerous allergens in the air can penetrate the body\u2019s defenses, triggering an overactive immune response.\nAn allergic reaction occurs when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance \u2013 ragweed, pollen, pet hair, etc. \u2013 that doesn\u2019t typically cause a response in the majority of the population. The response by your immune system is to produce antibodies that target the foreign invader and mark it for destruction by your immune system. Unfortunately, adverse symptoms like stuffed-up sinuses, itchy eyes and fatigue also occur in conjunction with the immune response. This leaves you tired, struggling to focus and constantly rubbing your eyes or blowing your nose.\nSeasonal allergies like itchy and watery eyes can\u2019t be cured, but you can relieve symptoms with natural treatments.\nWhile you can\u2019t cure seasonal allergies, there are a number of conventional and more natural approaches to addressing the symptoms and the root cause. Before we look at your options this fall, let\u2019s take a closer look at the most common (and not so common) symptoms of allergy, along with the worst offenders that trigger these reactions.\nWhat causes these symptoms and the over-activation of your immune system? Here is a short list of the worst allergy offenders.\nRagweed is the most common allergen in the fall. If you struggle with spring allergies, there is a 75% chance you\u2019ll also have reactions to ragweed in the fall. Ragweed begins to release its pollen in late summer, and the symptoms of watery and itchy eyes, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and dark circles under the eyes typically start in September and continue on until the end of October. Think you\u2019re in the clear because ragweed is not in your area? Think again. Ragweed can travel hundreds of miles in the air and if you react to it, you may also suffer from food allergies to bananas, melon, cucumbers, zucchini, and sunflower seeds.\nMold is another major allergy trigger. Damp basements and bathrooms, as well as the damp ground as the leaves change colors and tumble to the ground, are perfect breeding grounds for mold. The return to school for kids can also trigger seasonal allergies, as schools can often be damp with mold present.\nDust mites are most common during the hot summer months, but once you kick up the heating in your house as summer turns to fall, the dust mites will begin to circulate through your house. They can trigger similar symptoms to mold and ragweed above.\nDust mites start to circulate when you turn on the heat in the fall, triggering allergic reactions for some.\nIf you suffer from allergies and visit your doctor, they\u2019ll typically diagnose you based on your symptom presentation, most commonly watery eyes and runny nose. If your doctor suspects multiple or severe allergies, they\u2019ll likely send you to a dermatologist for skin-allergy testing.\nThis type of \u201cskin-scratch\u201d allergy testing is classified as an IgA (or \u201cimmediate\u201d) immune reaction, and the doctor will typically place a series of allergens on your skin to determine which elicit a response. This type of allergy is different than a classic food allergy or IgG reaction, which is \u201cdelayed\u201d and more subtle, taking hours or several days to elicit symptoms (such as fatigue, joint pain, brain fog, dark circles under the eyes, etc.).\nThe standard medical treatments for seasonal allergies are steroid nasal sprays to cool inflammation in the nasal cavity, antihistamines to reduce sneezing and itching, and decongestants to dry up mucous. Unfortunately, none of these therapies targets the \u201croot cause\u201d of the immune system glitch, but rather suppresses its expression (i.e., the symptoms).\nTherefore, these can be effective treatments in the short-term \u2013 so you can get through your day, power through meetings and deadlines, or make it through your CrossFit workout or 5k run. However, in the long run, they\u2019re not the answer. Adding in more natural support can enhance the effectiveness of these conventional treatments and often reduce the dose you need to get through your day. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some great options.\nThe protein in cow\u2019s milk and gluten can leave your immune system in a state of hyperactivity, leading to the worsening of seasonal allergies (1). They can also create more phlegm in your mucous membranes, which can worsen your runny nose, congestion and post-nasal drip. Steer clear of dairy if you\u2019re struggling with allergies.\nQuercetin is a bioflavonoid and potent natural anti-histamine (2). It\u2019s also a potent anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory, which means it can get to the root of your allergies by calming your overactive immune system and cooling unwanted inflammation (3).\nThe best Paleo-friendly food sources of quercetin include veggies and fruits (such as raw red onions and apples), followed by raw asparagus, peppers, tomatoes and leafy greens. Unfortunately, if you suffer from allergies, the 10-50mg of quercetin you might get from foods is likely not potent enough to curb allergies. Consider supplementing with 500mg 2-3x per day for 2-4 weeks, or consult with your local naturopath or functional doctor.\nThe support you need to curb your allergy symptoms may just come from the \u201cpollinators\u201d themselves. A recent study found that regular honey-eaters had markedly reduced allergy symptoms compared to those who abstained (4). Honey has incredible antimicrobial properties and if you source local honey, you\u2019ll have the added advantage of fighting off your nearest allergens. Add it to your tea, mix it into warm water, or include it when making smoothies or shakes.\nStinging nettle (Urtica dioica) has been used for centuries as a medicinal plant, and used commonly in medieval Europe to treat joint pain. The fine hairs of stinging nettle contain chemicals that irritate the skin when they come into contact; ironically, however, they can also act as agents to reduce inflammation in the body (acting much like quercetin as a natural antihistamine) (5).\nStinging nettle tea can reduce inflammation in the body, easing allergy symptoms.\nTry drinking 2-4 cups of stinging nettle tea daily during allergy season (note: it\u2019s also a mild diuretic, so drink a glass of water between each cup of tea) or add a supplement during an acute allergy attack. Go Paleo and cook the leaves, adding them to your greens with dinner (i.e., like spinach) or into your morning smoothie. If your allergies trigger joint pain, they could also be applied topically to the area.\nAlmost all cultures across the globe have ancestral recipes that use the broth from cooked beef, chicken or fish bones to support health and fight off colds and flu as the seasons change. Bone broth soup can also help support seasonal allergies by keeping mucous membranes in the nose and throat clear of mucous and providing key amino acids like glutamine to support a healthy immune response.\nEucalyptus is a wonderful essential oil that has antimicrobial properties (6). To help cool your overactive immune system and fight off allergy symptoms, try a warm steam inhalation. Start by placing 3-4 drops of eucalyptus essential oil in a bowl, then pour about two cups of boiling water into the bowl. Place your face over the bowl (at a small distance so you don\u2019t burn yourself) and a towel over your head\u2026 now breathe through your nose for 8-10 minutes and you\u2019re all set! This is a great regular practice to get into to fight off allergies (as well as colds and flu) through the fall and winter seasons.\nClogged sinuses and mucous-filled lungs are the uncomfortable norm in allergy season for seasonal sufferers. Another essential oil, peppermint, has been shown to be an effective anti-spasmodic to relieve chronic coughing and respiratory congestion due to allergies (7). Peppermint oil can be diffused through the house or your bedroom at night to help ameliorate symptoms (i.e., 4-5 drops).\nFall allergy season is here; limit the foods that can worsen your allergic reaction (i.e., dairy and gluten), increase your intake of anti-inflammatory and anti-histamine nutrients (quercetin, stinging nettles, and raw honey), and reduce congestion and immune reaction with a warm eucalyptus nasal douche. These simple tips can help keep you and your health on track this fall.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T08:16:50Z", "url": "https://dev.paleohacks.com/seasonal-allergies/", "byte_size": 8475, "char_size": 8407}

{"text": "It is not a myth! If you buy property in Spain you can get a Spanish residency permit (this is the correct bureaucratic terminology for Spain\u2019s golden visa), which allows you to live in Europe. The only challenge is the paperwork, and you must invest at least 500.000 \u20ac. Keep reading for the details . . .\nIn 2013 Spain passed a law that gives residency permits to non-EU citizens in exchange for a property investment of 500.000 \u20ac or more. The idea is to attract foreign investment and create jobs. This will stimulate the economy and reduce public debt.\nWe have many clients that have taken advantage of Spain\u2019s Golden Visa. In this article we address their most frequently asked questions. We explain the difference between a visa and a residence permit, details about the type of property purchases that qualify, timing and more!\nQ: Can I apply for Spain\u2019s Golden Visa with more than one property if each property is less than 500.000 \u20ac?\nYes. You can use more than one property to qualify for Spain\u2019s Golden Visa as long as the amount invested is equal to or greater than 500.000 \u20ac.\nQ: Is there a certain period in which the purchases must take place? Suppose I buy one property now and another, say, a year later?\nCurrently there are no requirements on the timing of your purchases. The only potential problem would be if the Spanish Government modified the law. Please note that this type of thing has been known to occur. Spanish laws do respond to external factors. For example, the law that created Spain\u2019s Golden Visa was established in 2013. At that time there was a deep economic crisis, caused by the collapse of Spain\u2019s housing bubble. There was a large inventory of unsold properties that were seized, or slated to be seized, by Spanish banks. These weighed heavily on public and private debt. Since domestic housing demand was virtually non-existent, the country did everything it could do encourage foreign investment.\nLike any law, this one could undergo changes. For example, if the government decided it was more interested in infrastructure development, as opposed to selling real estate, it could increase the minimum floor for real estate investment and offer more advantageous programs for infrastructure investment. If this were to happen before you submitted your application, it could be negatively impacted.\nIn our opinion, this law will not suffer important changes in the next five to ten years. However, it is important to know that there is a small chance that the law could change We will tell you why we don\u2019t think it will undergo material changes in coming years.\nQ: Can the law regarding the right to have a Golden Visa be changed retroactively?\nOne of the cornerstones of the Spanish legal system is that laws don\u2019t have retroactive effects. This achieves legal stability with respect to acquired rights. Thus retroactive change is only applied in very exceptional cases.\nQ: How long does Spain\u2019s Golden Visa last?\nPlease note that there are two steps to this process. First you obtain the visa, which is a stamp in your passport issued by a Spanish Consulate. It allows you to travel to Spain, with multiple entries and exits, for one year. Within this year you should travel to Spain and apply for your residency permit. You must apply for this in Spain.\nQ: How long are the residency permits valid?\nResidency permits are initially valid for two years. After this period you can renew it. This renewal is valid for five years. You can continue renewing it every five years as long as you own properties in Spain. You do not have to reside in Spain in order to be allowed to renew your residency permit.\nA: In order to start the Golden Visa/Residency Permit process you must first purchase properties in excess of 500.000 \u20ac. You will need the purchase agreement(s) and the deed(s) to prove that you have made the investment(s). For information on how to obtain your title and other documentation, read 5 steps to take after purchasing property on Costa de Sol.\nA: Once you apply for your residence permit, it takes about 60 days. Roughly 30 days to complete the application process and 30 days to receive your ID card.\nQ: Does the Golden Visa only apply to me or can I extend it to family members?\nA: Spain\u2019s Golden Visa extends to immediate family members. As Spain is one of the best places in the world to raise children, this is an attractive option if you have a family. Spouses and dependent children under the age of eighteen years are guaranteed residency permits. For all other family members you must present paperwork proving they are your legal dependants.\nQ: Can I get a mortgage to purchase my property?\nA: Yes, but it has to be from a foreign bank. The logic is that will bring 500,000 \u20ac of foreign investment into Spain. If you borrow money from a Spanish bank, you are not bringing money into the country. Our recommendation is to either pay in cash, or have your financing lined up before you purchase. Ideally, this will be with a bank you\u2019ve done business with for years.\nQ: If I buy property through a company, can I still get a Golden Visa?\nA: Yes you can. All you have to do is prove that you, directly or indirectly, hold the majority of the voting rights and have the power to appoint or dismiss the majority of the board of directors. This needs to be demonstrated through official documents such as your company\u2019s articles of incorporation. These documents should be notarized and translated into Spanish.\nQ: Are there any scenarios under which the immigration authorities will deny renewing your residence permit?\nBasically there are only two scenarios under Spain\u2019s Golden Visa program where you would be denied renewal. First, if you sell your property or transfer it into someone else\u2019s name. Second, if you have a criminal record. If you have a criminal record you will not receive an initial residency permit.\nWhen you purchase property in excess of 500,000 \u20ac you will receive a multiple entry visa which is valid for one year. Within this year you must go to Spain and apply, in person, for your residency permit. It is valid as long as you keep your Spanish properties in your name. You do not need to reside in Spain, but will have to come here each time you need to renew your residency permit. This is because you have to personally apply for your Spanish ID card.\nIf you decide to live in Spain, you are eligible for permanent residency after 5 years. However, you have to demonstrate that you did not spend more than eleven months outside of Spain within the prior five years. Once you have a permanent residency permit you do not need to renew it. You just renew your ID card which is very fast and easy.\nAs you may heard of, navigating the Spanish bureaucracy can be time consuming, tricky and frustrating! We advice lawyers, who have applied for many Golden Visas and residence permits for our customers and can make the process very easy for you. Given the time and headache the lawyers can save you, we think you will find using their services a very worthwhile investment.\nEs ist kein Geheimnis! Wenn Sie eine Immobilien in Spanien kaufen, k\u00f6nnen Sie eine spanische Aufenthaltserlaubnis bekommen (das ist die genaue b\u00fcrokratische Ausdrucksweise f\u00fcr spanisches Golden Visa), die gleichzeitig erlaubt, dass Sie in Europa leben. Die einzige Herausforderung ist der Papierkram und dass Sie mindestens 500.000 \u20ac investieren m\u00fcssen. Weiter zu den Details\u2026..\nIn 2013 hat Spanien ein Gesetz erlassen, dass einem Nicht-EU-B\u00fcrger die Aufenthaltserlaubnis genehmigt, im Gegenzug f\u00fcr ein Immobilien Investment von 500.000 \u20ac oder mehr. Die Idee ist, ausl\u00e4ndische Investoren ins Land zu bringen und Arbeitspl\u00e4tze zu schaffen. Dies w\u00fcrde die Wirtschaft ankurbeln und die Staatsschulden reduzieren.\nWir haben viele Kunden, die diese M\u00f6glichkeit des Golden Visa in Anspruch genommen haben. In diesem Artikel beantworten wir die von ihnen meist gestellten Fragen. Wir erkl\u00e4ren den Unterschied zwischen Visa und Aufenthaltserlaubnis, \u00fcber die Art des Immobilienerwerbs, die die Aufenthaltsgenehmigung m\u00f6glich macht, sowie den Zeitaufwand und mehr!\nFrage: Kann ich ein spanisches Gold Visa beantragen, wenn ich mehr als eine Immobilie erwerbe, diese aber jeweils unter 500.000 \u20ac kosten?\nJa, Sie k\u00f6nnen mehrere Immobilien erwerben um ein Gold Visa zu beantragen, so lange das Gesamtvolumen des Investments \u00fcber 500.000 \u20ac.\nFrage: Gibt es ein Zeitlimit bis die K\u00e4ufe get\u00e4tigt werden m\u00fcssen? Zum Beispiel, ich kaufe jetzt eine Immobilie und in einem Jahr eine Weitere?\nZur Zeit gibt es keine Bedingungen diesbez\u00fcglich. Das einzige Problem das auftreten kann ist, dass die spanische Regierung das Gesetz \u00e4ndert. Wohlgemerkt k\u00f6nnte dieser Fall eintreten. Das spanische Gesetz reagiert auf externe Faktoren. Zum Beispiel wurde das Gesetz f\u00fcr das Gold Visa in 2013 erlassen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war eine schwere Wirtschaftskrise, die zum spanischen Immobilien-Crash gef\u00fchrt hatte. Es gab einen riesigen Bestand an nicht-verkauften Immobilien die betroffen waren, von Banken \u00fcbernommen zu werden. Dies war schwerwiegend f\u00fcr die staatliche und private Verschuldung. Seit die Nachfrage nach heimischen Wohnimmobilien quasi nicht mehr existent war, hat das Land alles getan, ausl\u00e4ndische Devisen und Investments zu holen.\nWie jedes Gesetz kann sich dieses ebenfalls ver\u00e4ndern. Zum Beispiel, sollte die Regierung entscheiden, dass der Ausbau der Infrastruktur interessanter ist als der Verkauf von Immobilien, dies w\u00fcrde M\u00f6glichkeiten er\u00f6ffnen f\u00fcr Infrastruktur Investitionen. Wenn das stattfindet bevor Sie Ihren Antrag gestellt haben, k\u00f6nnte dies negative Auswirkungen haben.\nUnserer Meinung nach wird es in den n\u00e4chsten 5 bis 10 Jahren keine besonderen \u00c4nderungen geben. Wie auch immer, es ist gut zu wissen, dass es eine geringe Chance gibt, dass sich dieses Gesetz doch \u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnte. Wir werden Ihnen sagen, warum wir nicht glauben, dass es massgeblichen \u00c4nderungen geben wird.\nFrage: Kann sich das Gesetz r\u00fcckwirkend \u00e4ndern bez\u00fcglich dem Recht ein Gold Visa zu besitzen?\nEine der Grunds\u00e4tze der spanischen Gesetzgebung ist, dass Gesetzes\u00e4nderungen niemals r\u00fcckwirkend greifen k\u00f6nnen. Das schafft gesetzliche Stabilit\u00e4t betreffend die erlangten Rechte. R\u00fcckwirkende \u00c4nderungen fanden nur in wenigen Ausnahmen statt.\nFrage: Wie lange dauert es ein Gold Visa zu bekommen?\nWohlgemerkt ist das Verfahren in 2 Schritten zu bewerkstelligen. Als Erstes erhalten Sie ein Visa, das ein Eintrag in Ihrem Passdokument sein wird durch ein spanisches Konsulat. Dieses erlaubt Ihnen nach Spanien ein- und auszureisen, so oft Sie m\u00f6chten f\u00fcr den Zeitraum eines Jahres.In dieser Zeit sollten Sie nach Spanien reisen und den Antrag auf Aufenthaltserlaubnis stellen. Der Antrag muss in Spanien gestellt werden.\nFrage: Wie lange ist die Aufenthaltserlaubnis g\u00fcltig?\nDie Aufenthaltserlaubnis ist zuerst f\u00fcr 2 Jahre g\u00fcltig. Danach kann sie f\u00fcr 5 Jahre verl\u00e4ngert werden. Sie k\u00f6nnen anschliessend die Aufenthaltserlaubnis immer wieder um 5 Jahre verl\u00e4ngern, solange Sie Eigent\u00fcmer einer Immobilie in Spanien sind. Sie m\u00fcssen nicht in Spanien bleiben, um eine Verl\u00e4ngerung der Aufenthaltserlaubnis zu erhalten.\nFrage: Wie beginne ich mit dem Antrag?\nUm mit dem Antrag der Aufenthaltserlaubnis/Gold Visa zu beginnen, m\u00fcssen Sie erst einmal eine Immobilie kaufen im Wert von 500.000 \u20ac. Sie brauchen die Kaufurkunde zum Beweis des Investments. Informationen wie man die Kaufurkunde erh\u00e4lt und weiter Dokumente, lesen Sie die 5 Schritte die zu tun sind nach dem Kauf einer Immobilie an der Costa del Sol.\nFrage: Wie lange dauert der Antragsprozedur?\nNachdem Sie den Antrag zur Aufenthaltserlaubnis gestellt haben, dauert es ca. 60 Tage. In etwa 30 Tage um die Antragsprozedur zu vervollst\u00e4ndigen und 30 Tage bis Sie Ihre ID Karte erhalten.\nFrage: Kann nur ich selbst das Gold Visa beantragen oder kann der Antrag auch f\u00fcr Familienmitglieder erweitert werden?\nDas spanische Gold Visa kann sofort auch f\u00fcr Familienmitglieder erweitert werden. Da Spanien eines der besten Pl\u00e4tze auf dieser Welt ist um Kinder gross zu ziehen, ist dies eine attraktive Option wenn Sie eine Familie haben. Ehepartner sowie Kinder unter 18 Jahren erhalten garantiert eine Aufenthaltserlaubnis. F\u00fcr alle weiteren Familienmitglieder m\u00fcssen Dokumente vorgelegt werden, die belegen, dass es gesetzlich anerkannte Angeh\u00f6rige sind.\nFrage: Kann ich eine Finanzierung erhalten f\u00fcr den Kauf der Immobilie?\nJa, aber es muss von einer ausl\u00e4ndischen Bank sein. Logischerweise sollen 500.000 \u20ac an Fremdkapital nach Spanien gebracht werden. Wenn Sie sich Geld einer spanischen Bank leihen, dann bringen Sie kein Geld ins Land. Unser Ratschlag ist entweder die Immobilie mit Eigenkapital zu kaufen oder aber die Finanzierung in Ihrem Land vorab zu regeln. Am Einfachsten wird es sein, die Finanzierung mit einer Bank zu t\u00e4tigen, mit der Sie seit langer Zeit arbeiten.\nFrage: Wenn ich die Immobilie durch eine Gesellschaft kaufen will, kann ich trotzdem das Gold Visa bekommen?\nJa Sie k\u00f6nnen. Sie m\u00fcssen lediglich beweisen, dass Sie direkt oder indirekt Inhaber der Mehrheitsanteile und dass Sie der Bevollm\u00e4chtigte der Gesellschaft sind, der den Vorstand/Administrador benennen und absetzen kann. Dies muss durch offizielle Dokumente belegt werden, wie zum Beispiel eine Gesellschaftsvertrag/Gr\u00fcndungsurkunde. Diese Dokumente m\u00fcssen notariell beglaubigt und ins Spanische \u00fcbersetzt sein.\nFrage: Gibt es irgendwelche Szenarien, die eine Verl\u00e4ngerung der Aufenthaltserlaubnis verhindern k\u00f6nnten?\nGrunds\u00e4tzlich gibt es nur 2 Szenarien des spanischen Gold Visa Programmes, dass die Verl\u00e4ngerung abgelehnt werden w\u00fcrde. Zum Einen, falls Sie Ihre Immobilie verkaufen oder an einen Dritten \u00fcbertragen w\u00fcrden. Zum Anderen, wenn Sie mit einer kriminellen Vergangenheit behaftet w\u00e4ren. In diesem Falle w\u00e4re allerdings bereits der Erstantrag abgelehnt worden.\nWenn Sie eine Immobilie erwerben, die mehr als 500.000 \u20ac kostet, erhalten Sie ein Visa um mehrmalig einreisen zu k\u00f6nnen innerhalb eines Jahres. In diesem Zeitraum m\u00fcssen Sie in Spanien und pers\u00f6nlich den Antrag auf Aufenthaltserlaubnis stellen. Es wir so lange g\u00fcltig sein so lange Sie Ihre Immobilie in Spanien auf ihren Namen behalten. Sie m\u00fcssen nicht in Spanien wohnen bleiben, aber Sie m\u00fcssen jedes Mal, wenn die Aufenthaltserlaubnis verl\u00e4ngert werden soll, pers\u00f6nlich die Verl\u00e4ngerung in Spanien beantragen. Auch deshalb, weil die spanische ID Karte pers\u00f6nlich beantragt werden muss.\nWenn Sie sich entscheiden in Spanien zu leben, sind Sie berechtigt nach 5 Jahren die unbefristete Aufenthaltserlaubnis zu beantragen. Hierzu m\u00fcssen Sie beweisen, dass Sie nicht mehr als 11 Monate ausserhalb Spaniens verbracht haben w\u00e4hrend den ersten 5 Jahren. Wenn Sie dann die unbefristete Aufenthaltserlaubnis erhalten haben, besteht keine Notwendigkeit mehr zu einer Verl\u00e4ngerung. Es muss dann lediglich die ID Karte verl\u00e4ngert werden, das sehr schnell und einfach von statten geht.\nWie Sie sicherlich schon geh\u00f6rt haben, kann es sehr zeitaufwendig, kompliziert und frustrierend sein, sich durch die spanische B\u00fcrokratie zu k\u00e4mpfen! Wir empfehlen Ihnen Anw\u00e4lte, die bereits Antr\u00e4ge f\u00fcr viele Gold Visas und Aufenthaltsgenehmigungen f\u00fcr unsere Kunden gestellt haben. Dies wird f\u00fcr Sie die Prozedur erheblich erleichtern. Die Zeit und die Kopfschmerzen einem Anwalt zu \u00fcberlassen, denken wir, wird sich f\u00fcr Sie als lohnendes Investment erweisen.\nKontaktieren Sie uns gerne um einen Termin zu vereinbaren zur kostenlosen Beratung.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T08:40:49Z", "url": "https://immobilien-andalusien.eu/unser-service/golden-visa/", "byte_size": 15631, "char_size": 15463}

However, the internet is full of tips for weight loss, but not every tip is effective. Since the reliability of the tips cannot be authenticated, it is hard to decide which tips are worth trying.\nThis is the reason why many people end up following tips that are not helpful and making mistakes. Don\u2019t worry, we are here to help you.\nIn this post, we have listed the most common mistakes made by people trying to get in shape. Have a look!\nDo you know any fitness fanatic who is trying fad diets? I didn\u2019t think so. This is because fit people bring a change in their eating habits and lifestyle rather than trying different diets. To help you embrace healthy eating, you need to learn to listen to your body. By answering questions like what food keeps you full or what makes you feel good or what keeps you energized during workouts, you can know what works for you. Hence, if you want to maintain your fitness level, then you should not try every diet.\nThere is a very little chance that there is a person who refuses to take a bite of chocolate and be okay with it. Since nobody is perfect, people can\u2019t eat perfectly all the time. In order to stay healthy and fit, you need a little cheat in a meal. This doesn\u2019t mean that your every meal should be a cheat. It is best to decide a day when you are allowed to cheat in your meals.\nThe reason you need a cheat day is that you will not go crazy and won\u2019t feel bitter about your health.

{"text": "The Township of Ocean School District shall provide Health Benefits through the School Employee Health Benefits Program (SEHBP).\nDue to the changes to Health Insurance per Chapter 2 P.L. 2010 that are charged vary with each employee. Please check with Personnel for the cost of insurance. Premiums change every January 1st.\nOpen enrollment is held every October with any changes effective January 1st of the next year. There is a 60 day waiting period for all new employees.\n* Please note-If you have a dependent that has turned 23 during the year, they will automatically be continued on the medical and prescription coverage until age 26 but if you want your dependent to continue the dental insurance, they have to apply for COBRA Coverage. They must apply no later than 60 days after the end of the year.\nThere are many plans within the State Health Benefits that are available to all employees. See the State Website for all of your options.\nThe Board of Education shall provide a prescription drug insurance plan. The co-pay is $5.00 generic mail-in, $15.00 brand name mail-in(90 day supply), $3.00 for all generic claims retail and $10.00 for allbrand name claims retail with no annual deductible. The Board reserves the right to change the current carrier for a comparable program from another provider. Separate cards are issued for the prescription plan.\na) Dependents are covered as detailed under medical coverage.\nb) Cards are issued for Dental coverage.\n2. A child with a mental or physical disability may be continued in this program after the age of 23 as long as he/she remains incapacitated and unmarried, subject to the continuance of the employee'sown coverage in this program.\n3. Claim forms are available in the Personnel Office or at the office of the building principal.\n4. The Dependents to age 31 program does not apply to Dental coverage.\nA \"child\" is defined as an enrollee's child until age 26, regardless of the child's marital, student, or financial dependency status - even if the young adult no longer lives with his or her parents.\nCoverage will be extended to eligible children through December 31 of the year they turn age 26.\n2. After the age of 26, dependents are eligible for the Dependent to Age 31 Program (Chap 375) for medical and prescription only, dental is excluded. Dependents can stay on this group until they turn 31 (specifically the 1st of the month following their 31st birthday). They can also enroll later if they lose coverage elsewhere as long as the parent is enrolled in our group. The monthly premium for the dependent to age 31 group is approximately 60% of the single premium for medical and prescription program.\n3. Dependents are covered under dental until the end of the year in which they turn 23. After the age of 23 dependents are eligible for dental under COBRA, and the dental can be continued for up to 36 months only. The monthly premium for the dental is 102% of the single dental premium. Application for COBRA dental must be made with 60 days of the end of the year in which the dependent turns 23.\nThe Federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, (COBRA), gives employees, spouses, and dependent children currently enrolled under the Township of Ocean Board of Education's health benefits program, the opportunity to purchase continued health benefits for a limited period of time after a COBRA qualifying event occurs - (18 months for employee, 36 months for dependents). COBRA applies to employees and dependents who would otherwise lose coverage as a result of a COBRA qualifying event.\nIt is the responsibility of the employee to notify Patty DeAngelis for medical prescription and dental of a COBRA event as listed in items 3,5, and 6 (above) within 60 days of the event. The COBRA participant pays 100% of the cost plus an additional 2% administrative fee.\nA qualifying event (changes) such as marriage, birth of a child, divorce, separation, number of dependents, or child attaining age 26 must be reported to Patty DeAngelis within 30 days of the event for change in coverage to take effect.\nHIPAA: The privacy and security of medical records of each individual employed with the Township of Ocean School District isguaranteed under the federal and state HIPAA legislation.

{"text": "\"You have a bunch of stuff and still talk about simplicity, what's with that?\"\nWell, I have accumulated a few things in my life. I used to make a lot of money (relatively speaking). I bought the Mercedes, the toys, the stuff.\nI have gotten rid of a lot, and am trying to learn to get rid of the rest. I want to keep only what I need, and maybe a few wants. It is hard. I grew up with little, so when I was making decent money, I wanted to buy the stuff I never had. Over time I have come to the realisation the stuff never made me happy. I found the doing is better than the having.\nI have acquired many of the things I have by coincidence or luck. I am not afraid to dumpster-dive. I take my kids if I can, we make it a game. I have stopped on the side of the road to pick up something that someone else is tossing out. My wheelbarrow came from the dump, some guy was tossing it because \"it's annoying\", whatever that means.\nI have traded a lot. Craigslist is my friend when it comes to trading.\nValue is the governing factor with the things I possess. I was going to say own, but I don't think I own anything, I just possess it until it leaves my possession. I still have trouble letting go though, some things just have too much potential.\nI feel qualified to share my experiences and tips with the world because I am actually doing every one of the steps on my list. I have been unemployed for 16 months (I did work for two months in the middle there). For ten of those months I collected no unemployment benefits. I now am collecting unemployment benefits (I felt that I shouldn't do it, but someone reminded me that it was my money). I am going to school on the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, and making it work on the little money I get from these two sources. My wife is a nurse and can make good money, but we choose for her to work less so she can be home for the summer with the kids. During the rest of the year she works and we save, we have eliminated most of our bills to make this a possibility. I am now unemployed by choice because juggling school, work, and kids is too much for anyone person and my heart goes out to those that manage to do it. My wife was in that position when we met and I quickly convinced her to stop working and let me handle the money part so she could continue her schooling. I saw how hard it can be, and do not want to do that myself (she is definitely stronger than me).\nI like stuff, it is programmed into me from my childhood, from TV, from the outside forces of the media and U.S. culture. I am trying to de-program myself.\nInstead of working hard just so we can pay the credit card bills and loans for the stuff we don't need, we work what we need to, just so we can do the things that give us the one thing we truly own, memories.\nI've recently started reading your blog after a connection from the Bike Trailer Blog. Your situations sound very similar to mine. I applaud you for continuing education even though it may be hard financially for your family. My wife supported me and worked while I finished my degree, though we didn't have our daughter until I graduated and got my first salary job. Now my wife doesn't work so she can stay home with the little one (18 months).\nYou also posted about getting rid of your car. This is something I did about 6 months ago. We have one car (Honda CRV) and I bike to work everyday though it's a short 10 blocks. I can say we are just now over the initial regret stage and are enjoying it. I have sacrificed a few things, but I have also gained a few things (non-material).\nI have a book recommendation for you since you're talking about getting rid of stuff. \"Put Your Life on a Diet\". This is a short read by a guy who lives by himself in a small 140 Sq. Ft. trailer. He's not saying you should live in a trailer, but he does have lots of ideas about slimming down not only yourself but everything else in your life. I was very inspired by this and have recently rid my entire house of things that haven't been used in one year (to the tune of about $400). Like you I am also a Craigslist veteran.\nI can't say I share your view on tools though. I feel it's less important to have a good set of tools and more important to have a neighbor who has a good set of tools (and a good relationship with such a neighbor). I've cleaned my gutters quarterly using my neighbor's 10 ft. step ladder.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T12:22:17Z", "url": "http://www.hackin5hit.com/2010/06/little-background.html", "byte_size": 4374, "char_size": 4374}

{"text": "This article aims to demonstrate how leggings are not a garment that can only be worn by one age bracket. By paying particular attention to how leg wear can be worn and with what other garments, it is the aim to support the fact that leggings can be worn by ladies of all ages.\nLeggings have often been a garment associated with childrenswear. With their ease of movement and comfortable style, they are appropriate for a growing child who may change in size regularly. Stirrup style leggings are also popular amongst those purchasing childrenswear.\nEmerging from the eighties era, leg wear also become popular during this time when fitness wear was deemed stylish and worn as everyday wear. Popularised by chart topping bands of the time and the likes of Jane Fonda's workout videos, fitness wear was definitely a trend that many associate tight fitting leg wear with today. Whilst during the eighties, neon bright colours were popular for leg wear, but since then styles have developed and we now see that prints and patterns have become more and more popular. Seen on catwalks throughout London, Paris, Milan and New York, prints are consistently in fashion and are unlikely to ever go out. Whilst some prints come in and out of fashion such as animal print, other prints quickly come into replace them such as this season's popular print of dogtooth. What remains in style is the basic design of the garment such as classic leggings.\nDepending on the occasion they are worn for will also coincide with an acceptable age to wear leggings. For example, if an older lady wore leggings to the cheap, she may not be judged as much as if she was to wear them on a night out. Whilst they do make great gym wear, it is not to say that they cannot be worn for nights out. Recently popularised by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, leather look leg wear is at the height of fashion and create the perfect look for a night out, but should these style of leggings have an age restriction?\nIf the wearer feels comfortable in the garment, why should there be an age restriction? Yes it is clear that some styles will be more suited to some ages than others but it remains entirely the wearers choice.\nAnother consideration would have to be gender. There is nothing to say that men can also not wear leggings, if it is acceptable for the gym it should be acceptable for everyday wear.\nConclusively, leg wear has developed dramatically over the years and is clear to see that no age restrictions should be applicable when considering who can or cannot wear leggings.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T02:53:50Z", "url": "http://rockyvalla009.weebly.com/pantyhose-for-women-of-any-age.html", "byte_size": 2555, "char_size": 2555}

{"text": "What risks do women face when seeking advice during pregnancy from pharmacies and natural health retailers?\nNatural health products are popular among pregnant women in Australasia,1,2 yet potential risks of exposure to teratogenic herbs, vitamins and other substances raise concerns regarding the present lack of effective regulation of the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) industry in New Zealand.\nNatural health (or CAM) products, including herb, mineral and vitamin supplements, are marketed for pregnancy on the basis of health promotion as well as to remedy pregnancy-associated ailments such as nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP).\nThe key issue that this study sought to investigate was the risks which a woman may face when seeking advice regarding NVP, and vitamin supplementation during pregnancy from pharmacies and health food stores (HFS) in Greater Wellington.\nA search of The Yellow Pages telephone directory in February 2010 identified 26 Health Food Stores (HFS) in the Greater Wellington region. Of these, 5 were excluded: 3 were no longer in operation, 1 was a residential property, and 1 specialised in sports supplements.\nTwenty-one HFS and 21 geographically-matched pharmacies (on the basis of closest location to the HFS) were visited by the same researcher between the months of February to July 2010.\nWith each visit, the researcher commenced a conversation with a retail assistant by saying she was 6\u20138 weeks pregnant, having problems with morning sickness, and enquiring about any herbal products which the retail assistant could recommend to help reduce nausea. The researcher would then ask what the retail assistant could recommend with regards to vitamin supplementation. Finally she asked which vitamins were important during pregnancy and if there were any to avoid.\nIf questioned by the retail assistant, the researcher would reply, as appropriate, saying she was: 30 years old, married, excited about her first pregnancy, currently working in a clerical office job, and otherwise fit and healthy with no previous medical history.\nDuring each interaction, the researcher would take note of the products recommended and their prices, and upon leaving immediately complete a standardised data collection form to document the advice received. The ingredients of each recommended product were later confirmed by searching for the product on the Internet.\nThe NZ MOH Food and Nutrition Guidelines of Healthy Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women (revised 2008) was the standard against which all advice was compared. For ingredients not noted therein, a database search using Medline was performed for evidence of safety during the first trimester of pregnancy.\nSafe\u2014Product contains ingredients which are not absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy or their daily dose does not exceed the upper limit recommended by NZ MOH guidelines, or, if the ingredient is unknown, there is no evidence that it may be unsafe by Medline search of the literature.\nUnsafe\u2014Product contains ingredients which are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy or the daily dose exceeds the upper limit recommended by NZ MOH guidelines, or, if the ingredient is unknown, there is evidence that it may be unsafe by Medline search of the literature.\nCorrect\u2014Dose advised corresponds with NZ MOH guidelines for supplementation with 800 mcg/day in low-risk pregnancy.\nIncorrect\u2014Folic acid not recommended or dose advised was less than 800 mcg/day.\nAdvice regarding vitamin supplementation in early pregnancy \u2013 Vitamin A overdose risk.\nSafe\u2014Advice given did not pose risk of vitamin A overdose. This includes recommendation of a multivitamin product marketed for pregnancy which did not contain doses of vitamin A exceeding 3000mcg/day of retinol, even without demonstrating explicit vitamin A overdose awareness.\nUnsafe\u2014Advised that there is no limit to vitamin dosing during pregnancy or recommended a product containing >3000 mcg/day of retinol or advised to take any generic multivitamin.\nA statistically significant McNemar's test means the marginal proportions of the contingency table are different. In the analysis McNemar\u2019s test is based on an exact test whereas the confidence interval is based on asymptotic (large sample) assumptions. Where more than one product was recommended for nausea, the primary recommended products were compared in one analysis, and then the secondarily recommended products compared separately.\nThe number of matched pharmacies/HFS was based on an earlier study comparing the advice from HFS assistants with that of pharmacy assistants given to an individual presenting with symptoms suggestive of moderate to severe asthma who should be referred to a medical practitioner18 Based on this, it was calculated that the study would need to have 19 store/pharmacy pairs to have 80% power to detect the difference.\nThe study was approved by the Central Regional Ethics Committee.\nData was collected from 21 HFS and 21 geographically-matched pharmacies in the Greater Wellington region. The investigator was advised by retail assistants in all the HFS, with 6/21 (28.6%) HFS advising further discussion with a naturopath (n=2) or GP (n=4).\nIn 7/21 pharmacies, advice was indirectly (n=3) or directly (n=4) from the pharmacist. 9/21 (42.9%) of pharmacies referred the researcher to a GP (n=7) and/or midwife (n=2) during the interaction.\nTable 1 lists the products recommended for nausea and Table 2 summarises other recommendations made, including multivitamin supplementation.\nIn brackets = Number of HPS and P recommendations for the product. *Also contains herb mixture called cardiodoron 250mg/15 drops = Digestion, equiv. fresh plant juice: Hyoscyamus niger, herb 1mg; onopordon acanthium, flower 25mg; Primula veris, flower 25mg. Nausyn is licensed by Medsafe as a Medicine.\nAdvice given for nausea in the first trimester of pregnancy\u20145/21 (23.8%) of pharmacies and 1/21 (4.8%) of HFS made primary recommendations for nausea which were supported by the NZ MOH guidelines, with a non significant difference in marginal proportions of 19.1% (95%CI -2.3% to 40.4%), p=0.10.\nBoth pharmacies (14/21, 66.7%) and HFS (7/21, 33.3%), made primary recommendations which were contrary to NZ MOH safety guidance. The difference in marginal proportions was 33.4% (95%CI 5.9% to 60.8%), p= 0.07. With regards to recommendations of second-line products which were contrary to MOH safety guidance, this occurred in 7/21 (33.3%) of pharmacies and 10/21 (47.6%) of HFS with a non significant difference in marginal proportions of -14.3% (95%CI -41.6% to 13.0%), p=0.51. The most common reason for a product being considered unsafe was that it provided >1g ginger \u00b1 >50 mg pyridoxine in the maximum daily dose as directed (Table 1).\n7/21 (33.3%) of pharmacies and 0/21 (0%) of HFS advised GP consultation if nausea did not settle. Due to two zero cell counts in the paired contingency table, it was not possible to calculate McNemar\u2019s test or a confidence interval for the difference in paired proportions.\nAdvice promoting a balanced diet with folic acid supplementation\u20141/21 (4.8%) of HFS and 0/21 (0%) of pharmacies correctly advised that a balanced diet, along with folic acid supplementation, was recommended during pregnancy in otherwise healthy young women. However, 0/21 of HFS and 18/21 (85.7%) of pharmacies primarily recommended Elevit by Bayer, a multivitamin product which is licensed by Medsafe. Due to zero cell counts in the paired contingency tables, it was not possible to calculate McNemar\u2019s test or a confidence interval for the difference in these paired proportions.\nAdvice regarding folic acid\u2014The majority of those promoting folic acid supplementation advised that this was for the prevention of neural tube defects (14/20 pharmacies and 13/17 HFS). 20/21 (95.2%) of pharmacies and 10/21 (47.6%) of HFS correctly gave dosing recommendations on the basis of national standards, with a difference in marginal proportions of 47.6% (95%CI 22.5% to 72.7%), p=0.006. 1/21 (4.8%) of pharmacies and 4/21 (19.0%) of HFS did not actively recommend taking folic acid supplementation.\nAdvice regarding Vitamin A overdose risk\u20142/21 (9.5%) of pharmacies and 4/21 (19.0%) of HFS vitamin recommendations were unsafe due to the potential risk of vitamin A overdose, with a non significant difference in marginal proportions of -9.5%, p=0.69.\nBoth pharmacies and HFS recommended products for nausea in early pregnancy which did not adhere with NZ MOH safety guidance.\nA minority also provided potentially unsafe advice regarding vitamin supplementation. There were no statistically significant differences between stores in the majority of recommendations made, except pharmacies were more likely than matched HFS to advise correctly regarding folic acid dosing. While this difference is unsurprising taking into consideration that pharmacies promote Medsafe-approved folic acid products which only they can sell, it does demonstrate the positive influence of product approval.\nThis study supports the urgent introduction of regulatory reform of the CAM industry and the businesses which sell these products.\nThis study is the fourth in a series of surveys in New Zealand looking at the appropriateness of advice given by pharmacies and HFS for a range of medical conditions. Previous surveys have all raised concerns regarding the advice provided by HFS when compared with pharmacies.18\u201320 This is the first scenario to find that the standard of advice was, on the whole, similarly matched between both types of store.\nIn fact there was a trend towards the primary promotion of potentially unsafe products for NVP by pharmacies when compared with matched HFS. This is largely due to the primary promotion of homeopathy by HFS, which although only able to offer a placebo effect at best, is inherently safe.\nThere were several limitations of this study. One of these is the possibility of recall bias although advice was entered into a data collection sheet immediately following the interaction to minimize this. The study was limited by the sample size available to the researchers in the greater Wellington region and although no statistically significant differences were found the confidence intervals for the comparisons were quite wide.\nWhile this is the first study in New Zealand examining advice given by CAM retailers for a scenario of pregnancy, the closest comparative is a survey carried out in 2003 in North America.21 In this study, advice was sought from HFS via telephone for the treatment of nausea and migraines in early pregnancy. They found that HFS readily made recommendations, 5% of which were for products contraindicated in pregnancy, and most stores primarily promoted ginger for NVP giving incorrect dosing instructions.\nSince the 1990s the use of CAM has surged worldwide and the World Health Organization actively recommends the regulation of all complementary and herbal medicine products and practitioners.22 This is particularly so in situations where the practice of complementary medicine brings economic benefit. This is to ensure the quality of the service received and thus to protect the public from potential harm.\nThis study supports the introduction of the Natural Health Products Bill in New Zealand (currently before the Health Committee) which is aimed at improving regulation by making pre-marketing \u2018product approval\u2019 mandatory, establishing a database of permitted CAM ingredients, requiring product labeling and licensing of CAM product manufacturers.6 This proposed legislation would ensure that commercially available CAM products complied with national guidelines prior to appearing on the shelves. Furthermore it would help ensure the quality of the ingredients used.\nAnalysis of the contents of the recommended products was outside the scope of this study, but it would have been interesting to assess the accuracy of the listed ingredients.\nResearch has demonstrated a wide variation in the constituents of ginger present in commercially available ginger supplements.23 This not only has implications for the rights of the consumer, but lack of standardisation of the products used in research, as exemplified by the variety of preparations used in ginger studies, may create misleading results.\nFurther monitoring of the therapeutic claims made on product labeling is also appropriate; a number of products not registered as medicines by Medsafe, and therefore not permitted to make therapeutic claims, were found to do so.\nUnfortunately the proposed bill will not address the issue of setting minimum staff training requirements for the promotion of health food goods. Although only a minority provided unsafe advice regarding vitamin supplementation (e.g. 4.8% of pharmacies and 19.0% of HFS did not recommend folic acid) in the context of a retailer presenting themselves as a source of health advice to the public, any unsafe practice is unacceptable.\nIn conclusion, this study found that both HFS and pharmacy staff made potentially unsafe recommendations for nausea and vitamin supplementation in early pregnancy.\nMany of the pregnancy promoted products recommended often did not adhere to the safety guidance set out by the NZ MOH. This study supports the call for legislative change and high quality research to guide the practice of health care professionals and retailers who sell natural products which may exert both beneficial and harmful effects.\nThere are potential risks to mothers and their unborn babies with the incorrect use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) products during pregnancy. 21 Health Food Stores (HFS) and 21 geographically matched pharmacies were visited by a researcher who sought advice regarding vitamin supplementation and nausea in early pregnancy. A minority of pharmacies and HFS made primary recommendations for nausea which were supported by Ministry of Health guidelines, and both pharmacies and HFS recommended products contrary to these guidelines. Pharmacies were more likely to give advice consistent with MOH recommendations for folic acid. Regulatory reform of CAM products and those who sell them is called for in NZ.\nPotential risks to mother and foetus exist with the incorrect use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) products during pregnancy. This study aimed to identify the risks that a woman may face when seeking advice during pregnancy from pharmacies and health food stores (HFS) in Greater Wellington (New Zealand).\n21 HFS and 21 geographically-matched pharmacies were visited by a researcher who sought advice regarding vitamin supplementation and nausea in early pregnancy using a standardised scenario. Any advice given, including details of recommended products, was documented immediately upon leaving the premises. Proportions were obtained and paired contingency table analysis was used to examine the agreement between the matched pairs.\nA minority of pharmacies (5/21, 23.8%) and HFS (1/21, 4.8%) made primary recommendations for nausea which were supported by Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines, and both pharmacies (14/21, 66.7%) and HFS (7/21, 33.3%) recommended products contrary to these guidelines. A greater proportion of pharmacies gave advice consistent with MOH recommended dosage of folic acid supplementation than HFS (20/21, 95.2% vs 10/21, 47.6%). 2/21 (9.5%) of pharmacies and 4/21 (19%) of HFS gave advice with a potential risk of vitamin A overdose.\nPharmacies and HFS in Greater Wellington provided potentially hazardous advice, recommending products, often branded for pregnancy, which contradicted NZ MOH guidelines.

{"text": "ESCONDIDO (NEWS 8) \u2013 The long-running saga over what to do with the site of the former Escondido Country Club is coming to an end after the City Council on Wednesday voted on a proposed plan to build nearly 400 homes on the shuttered property.\nIn a 3-2 vote, the Escondido City Council approved a controversial housing development at the former country club.\nThe fight over the development has been going on for more than five years, and it got ugly when neighbors accused the property owner of dumping chicken manure as retaliation.\n\u201cFrom the bottom of my heart in the long run, this is going to be the best thing for us,\u201d said Michael Morasco, Escondido City Councilmember.\nLast month, the Escondido Planning Commission approved Santa Monica based New Urban West\u2019s housing development called The Villages \u2013 it would include 380 solar powered homes, a country club, a restaurant and open space on the Northwest side.\n\u201cWe believe that we have created the best possible plan \u2013 one that reflects that thoughtfully reflects and extremely complex set of factors,\u201d said Jonathan Frankel.\nIn 2014, voters rejected the plan. Three years later, the Escondido Country Club Homeowner\u2019s Organization \u2013 ECCHO- continues to fight the scaled down project on the 106 acres and said the project is too dense. They want half the housing and remain concern about traffic.\n\u201cThis whole deal does not make sense. It\u2019s an old community. It was not designed for this amount of homes,\u201d said one resident.\nDuring the fight, the former country club that was once a jewel became overgrown with weeds, was boarded up and was infested with drugs and graffiti.\nA victory for supporters Wednesday night, but opponents said the fight is not over.\n\u201cOur attorneys have said they are open to litigation,\u201d said Mike Slater.\nThe mayor voted against the project and said there were too many houses.\nNew Urban plans to start moving dirt by the middle of next year.

{"text": "On Friday, January 25, the San Marcos Chamber of Commerce hosted the 2019 Transportation Summit at the San Marcos Convention Center.\nThe event opened with a few words from Chamber President Jason Mock before he introduced this year\u2019s featured speaker, Jim Wimberly of Texas Aviation Partners. Texas Aviation Partners is the company that manages the San Marcos Regional Airport on behalf of the City of San Marcos.\nWimberly gave a presentation about the airport\u2019s features, which include a Federal Aviation Administration air control tower, fourteen businesses that provide services, such as but no limited to, car rental and fueling, three runways and four hundred acres available of future development.\nWimberley said the airport averages about 178 takeoffs and landings per day in traffic and is the only airport in Texas with the FAA designation as a reliever airport for two international airports.\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration, reliever airports are airports designated by the FAA to relieve congestion at Commercial Service Airports and to provide improved general aviation access to the overall community.\nWhen air traffic becomes \u201ccongested\u201d at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and the San Antonio International Airport, planes are diverted to the San Marcos Regional Airport.\nIn October 2018, the Texas Department of Transportation\u2019s Aviation Division announced the results of an Economic Impact Study, which reported the San Marcos Regional Airport had increased its contribution to local economy dramatically over the last eight years.\nWimberley said several projects were in the works at the airport including the expansion of Berry Aviation, the updating of the airport master plan, the \u201cGo Wheels Up! Texas\u201d Concert event to be held in May and a $10 million rehabilitation of the airport\u2019s longest taxiway.\nFollowing Wimberley\u2019s update, attendees heard from a three-person panel; panelists discussed the transportation issues the region faces and what improvements have been made or could be made as the area\u2019s population grows.\nPanelists included TxDOT Austin District Engineer Terry McCoy, Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority External Affairs Director Dee Anne Heath and San Marcos Director of Engineering Laurie Moyer.\nMock mediated the discussion and asked questions about congestion, project costs, interagency cooperation, community involvement and the different factors of transportation.\nMcCoy said keeping up with the population when it comes to transportation improvements is a challenge, but TxDOT works with partners, such as cities, counties and other organizations to deliver projects reliably and efficiently as well as maintain and operate the system the region or state has already.\nMoyer discussed the work the City of San Marcos has partnered with TxDOT and the processes involved to complete those projects. \u201cI think we all recognize we can\u2019t build roads fast enough for the number of people moving in,\u201d Moyer said.\nAccording to Moyer,he process with agencies like TxDOT was a good but long process, and the change happening in the community and the population doesn\u2019t stop or slow down while that process is going on.\nWhen asked about the future, Heath said no one knows exactly what the future will look like, and, \u201cI think technology, innovation is critical.\u201d Heath went on to say when it comes to transportation, experts have to look at things in a non-traditional way.\nMoyer said since people may not know what the future of transportation will look at, it made planning more important than ever. Moyer also noted the important of regularly updating those plans to accommodate new innovative advances and changes in the area. Mock asked McCoy when he thought the improvements to I-35 would be completed.\nWhile McCoy jokingly said, \u201cIt\u2019ll never be finished,\u201d he continued that the state would eventually run out of room to expand I-35 to accommodate the growth of those using it and would have to look at transportation alternatives.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T05:14:51Z", "url": "https://smcorridornews.com/san-marcos-area-chamber-of-commerce-hosts-2019-transportation-summit/", "byte_size": 4045, "char_size": 4007}

{"text": "Would Stephen Harper attack Libya simply to justify spending tens of billions of dollars on F-35 fighter jets? Perhaps. But, add on doing it for major Canadian investors, reinforcing his \u201cprincipled\u201d foreign policy rhetoric and reasserting western control over a region in flux, and you pretty much have the range of reasons why a half dozen CF-18s four other military aircraft and naval frigate are currently engaged in combat 10,000 km away from Canadian soil.\nOver the past five years, the Conservatives have further militarized Canadian foreign policy. Military spending is at its highest level since World War II \u2014 the Harper government expanded Canada\u2019s role in the occupation of Afghanistan, claimed that Russia is planning to attack and sent 2,000 troops to police Haitians after a devastating earthquake.\nThe Conservatives draw significant support from the military as well as its associated companies and culture. To get us in the fighting spirit, for instance, the Canadian Forces released onboard video footage of a CF-18 destroying a ground target in Libya.\nBut there is more to it than pleasing the Great White North\u2019s version of the military-industrial complex. On March 21, The Financial Times reported that western oil companies were worried that if Gaddafi defeated the rebels in the east of Libya he would nationalize their operations out of anger at the west\u2019s duplicity. Presumably, this includes Suncor, Canada\u2019s second largest corporation, which signed a multi-billion dollar 30-year oil concession with Libya in 2008.\nHome to the second largest amount of Canadian investment in Africa, instability in Libya has put a couple billion dollars worth of this country\u2019s corporate investment in jeopardy. Dru Oja Jay, editor of the Dominion and a candidate for the Mountain Equipment Co-op Board of Directors, notes \u201cCanadian investors are legitimately worried about what\u2019s going to happen to the $1 billion signing bonus Suncor paid out to the Libyan government, or whether SNC-Lavalin is going to recoup its investments in the country, which is home to 10 per cent of its workforce.\u201dAnd these are some of this country\u2019s most powerful corporations. Embassymagazine includes both Suncor and SNC-Lavalin\u2019s CEOs among the nine most influential business executives in determining Canadian foreign policy.\nWould a victorious Gaddafi have moved against Canadian companies? Even if he didn\u2019t, with all the bad press SNC and Suncor have received could they continue in Libya without regime change? Finally, will the rebels dependence on the west lead to better contract terms?\nUnlike Egypt or Tunisia, the Conservatives denounced Gaddafi\u2019s repression at the beginning of the Libyan uprising. This is partly because Gaddafi has never been on great terms with much of the West, even if there have been warmer relations in recent years. Also, the Conservatives were widely derided for supporting Egypt\u2019s Hosni Mubarak and (to a lesser extent) Ben-Ali in Tunisia to the bitter end. So Libya gave Harper an opportunity to re-affirm his \u201cprincipled\u201d foreign policy rhetoric.\nBeyond wanting to appear on the side of human rights and democracy, another element motivating the military intervention in Libya is the desire to influence the revolutions in bordering states Tunisia and Egypt, which are still in flux. Controlling Libya gives the West another point of leverage over developments in those countries. Bombing Libya tells democratic forces in the region that the west is prepared to use force to assert itself (as does tacit support for the Saudi military intervention in Bahrain).\nBeyond the inevitable death and destruction in Libya, the security council resolution further undermines state sovereignty, which provides the weakest states with some protection from the most powerful. This is the main reason why many Latin American and African countries have opposed the intervention.\nFinally, let\u2019s put the current moral outrage in perspective. A little over two years ago Israel launched a 22-day onslaught against Gaza that left some 1,400 people, mostly civilians, dead. There, the power imbalance between the two sides was much greater and the aggrieved population had been under the boot of the attacking force for as long as Gaddafi has ruled. Yet there was no talk of imposing a no-fly zone over Gaza. In fact, the Harper government cheered Israel on.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T07:14:42Z", "url": "https://yvesengler.com/2011/03/29/why-canada-attacked-libya/?shared=email&msg=fail", "byte_size": 4409, "char_size": 4371}
{"text": "The following is a summary of the breakout session \"Economic Development through Tourism & Events\" at the 2014 U.S.-Japan Council Annual Conference on October 10, 2014.\n- Mr. Tsukasa Harufuku, President and CEO, JTB Hawaii, Inc.\nThis session discussed successful tourism markets and how to promote international accessibility, including the impact on community and economic development. Panelists presented the case of tourism between Hawaii and Japan and discussed tourism policy how to attract visitors.\nThe Government of Japan established its tourism policy when former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was in power. The target was to welcome 10 million foreign tourists to Japan in 2010. Last year, Japan welcomed more than 10 million foreign tourists. However, Japan is still 27th in the world as a tourist destination. The No. 1 country is France (18 million) and the U.S. is No. 2 (17 million). Prime Minister Abe and his administration have drawn a plan to welcome 20 million foreign visitors by 2020.\nJapan will host the summer Olympic and Paralympic games in 2020. To boost the number of foreign visitors, the Government of Japan promotes the country\u2019s unique culture to the world. To achieve its goal, Japan needs to change not only its transportation system but also prepare multi-language signs and free Wi-Fi. Japan needs to make its tourism infrastructure universal. Cross-sector cooperation will also be needed.\nBrand USA is the organization that promotes U.S. tourism. The Obama administration signed the Travel Promotion Act in 2010 and Brand USA uses both the U.S. government and private companies, as well as the Japan Tourism Agency (JTA) and other foreign countries\u2019 tourism agencies, to welcome foreign visitors to the United States.\nTourists to Hawaii from Japan have a huge impact on Hawaii\u2019s economy and jobs. Large-scale events like hosting the concert of a Japanese pop group drew in 15,000 tourists from Asian countries.\nThe United States and Japan signed the \u201cJapan-U.S. Joint Promotional Agreement\u201d in 2012, dubbing that year the Japan-U.S. Tourism Exchange Year. Japanese tourists are No. 2 in term of the greatest number of foreign visitors who spend money in Hawaii during their travel. Therefore, the relationship between the two countries is indispensable for Hawaii\u2019s development and tax revenue.\nJapan envisions becoming a leading tourism nation after the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic games. Brand USA is also seeking ways to attract more foreign visitors. They cooperate with airline companies for promotional campaigns.\nDuring the Q&A session, the audience was interested in the difference between the Tokyo Olympic games in 1964 and 2020. The answer was that the Olympics in 1964 did not have any strategy for tourism, while there is a strategic plan in place for 2020. Japan also aims to invite more foreign visitors to local cities.\nChinese tourists have a huge impact on both the United States and Japan. The United States is still considering how to welcome increasing Chinese tourists. It is said that Chinese tourists will be the No. 1 visitor in 2018, but the United States is not ready for that. All panelists agree that tourism brings goodwill and peace to each country.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T00:06:14Z", "url": "http://www.usjapancouncil.org/economic_development_through_tourism_events_summary_2014_annual_conference", "byte_size": 3231, "char_size": 3219}

{"text": "All Saints Day is followed the next day by the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed, more commonly known as All Souls Day. All Souls Day is a day set aside for honoring and praying for the dead. This celebration of All Souls stems from the Catholic doctrine that the souls of the faithful departed who at their death have not been cleansed from the temporal punishment due to their venial sins and from attachment to their mortal sins. They cannot immediately attain the beatific vision in heaven and so are in a state of purification which we know as Purgatory.\nOur Catholic Faith teaches us that our beloved dead are aided by our many prayers and by the offering of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. In other words, when they died, they had not yet attained full sanctification and moral perfection, a requirement for entrance into Heaven. This sanctification is carried out posthumously in Purgatory. The Masses we offer aid not only the living but also the dead. This is why there is such a venerable tradition of remembering our loved ones who have died with Masses on anniversaries or Month\u2019s Mind.\nAll Souls Days Masses are at 7:30am, 9am and 12:05pm. All Souls Day is not a holy day of obligation but I encourage you to come to Mass and pray for the souls in Purgatory. If you cannot make it to Mass on Monday, please offer prayers for the dead especially your beloved dead and those souls who have no one to pray for them.\nIn a special way we will remember the souls of the faithful departed who rest in our parish cemetery, St. Patrick\u2019s. The OLM School students will process to St. Patrick\u2019s Cemetery following the 9am All Souls School Mass. You are most welcome to join with them as we pray and process for the faithful departed of our parish family. Cemeteries are not \u201cspooky\u201d places but rather they are signs of faith and hope for the resurrection of those buried there. Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them. May all the souls of the faithful departed, through the Mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.\nHappy All Saints Day!

{"text": "September 27, 2018 \u2014 There\u2019s no denying electrical safety in the workplace is critically important\u2014not just for electrical contractors themselves, but also for the operators of electrical equipment and for business productivity.\nProperly maintaining electrical equipment plays a key role in creating a safe workplace. Yet a number of Canadian companies don\u2019t have an electrical equipment maintenance program or understand its importance.\nIn fact, it was only in 2013, when CSA Z463, Guideline on Maintenance of Electrical Systems, was introduced, that Canada finally had a document on electrical maintenance, explains Kerry Heid, chair of the Z463 Technical Committee.\nAnd even then, Z463 was only introduced as a guideline, which is more of a \u201crecommended practice,\u201d Heid says. This will now change with the release of CSA Z463, Standard on Maintenance of Electrical Systems, in September.\nWhat is Z463? Put simply, it is a standard that requires companies to create an electrical equipment maintenance program, explains Terry Becker, a member of the Z463 Technical Committee.\nThe standard recommends a number of such strategies, he adds, including predictive, preventive, run-to-fail, reliability-centred and risk-based.\nAs a standard on electrical maintenance, Z463\u2019s scope is very broad, covering equipment for power generation, transmission and distribution, transformers, cables, switchgear and much more.\nAnnex M of Z463, explains Becker, provides a set of tables that identify these types of electrical equipment, provide guidance for recommended electrical tests and, based on the level of importance of service, the frequency at which these tests should be performed on the equipment.\nHowever, Heid points out, it does not cover overhead lines or residential electrical equipment.\nZ463\u2019s ultimate priority, Becker argues, is safety. Following this standard will ensure reliability of service and manage damage through protective devices, he explains.\nIf electrical equipment is not maintained properly, on the other hand, then there is the risk of failure.\n\u201cWhen qualified electrical professionals have to work on it, we want to minimize their exposure to arc flash and shock hazards,\u201d he says.\nPredictive maintenance is one possible strategy for reducing these types of exposure.\nIn fact, Heid points out, Z463 lists 10 different online maintenance diagnostic tests, including visual inspections, corona imaging, acoustics, ultrasound and vibration analysis.\nBut not all of these tests are mandatory.\nGiven this focus, there is clearly a strong relationship between Z463 and CSA Z462, Standard on Workplace Electrical Safety.\nZ462 also defines normal operating conditions of energized electrical equipment, Becker adds.\nWhen an arcing fault is accidentally created, then \u201cthe power circuit breaker with protected relay functions as predicted, so we limit the incident energy, i.e. the heat released from an arc flash,\u201d Becker explains.\nWith the release of Z463 as a standard, Becker says there is now a \u201csafety trifecta\u201d in Canada.\n\u201cThe Canadian Electrical (CE) Code Part 1 covers safe installations, CSA Z462 covers safe workplaces and then Z463 helps bring those two together,\u201d he explains.\nThis is an important change, he says, because the CE Code mandates the safe installation of electrical equipment, but does not include maintenance requirements, while Z462 recognizes the need for safe workplace practices when working on and operating energized electrical equipment.\nAs a result, you\u2019ll have better reliability and more uptime.\nCompany managers may be wondering about additional impacts of Z463 on their business, such as costs and training. Fred Tanguay, a consultant for Canada Training Group, is answering this call by teaching them how to integrate and implement Z463 into their maintenance programs. In his opinion, the standard will help drive the requirement for proper maintenance home.\nHe acknowledges many companies might be averse to Z463 because of the cost.\nConsequently, he says it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely paramount\u201d for companies to maintain their electrical systems properly. If the equipment malfunctions or breaks, \u201cthe repair cost is usually 50 times the replacement cost,\u201d since companies have to pay for overtime, temporary power supplies, and account for production loss.\nIt\u2019s not just the employees who operate and maintain the equipment that need to understand Z463, Tanguay explains. But he often sees only these workers attending his classes.\nIn applying this standard, Becker says, companies will turn to electrical contractors. Indeed, contractors who market electrical equipment maintenance to their clients can use Z463 to help them develop maintenance strategies, tests and test frequencies.\nHeid agrees Z463 will be extremely beneficial in helping electrical contractors convince their clients of the importance of well-maintained systems and equipment.\nDespite the benefits and value of Z463, Becker points out, it has not been widely adopted.\nCSA will promote Z463 as a standard on its website, through its social media channels and at conferences. The Technical Committee will promote it, as well.\nThis article originally appeared in the September 2018 issue of Electrical Business.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T06:52:07Z", "url": "https://www.ebmag.com/articles/completing-the-safety-trifecta-understanding-the-impact-of-csa-z463-20496", "byte_size": 5273, "char_size": 5227}

Stephens had driven impressively to work his way from 25th on the grid to 12th, only to be forced off the road when veteran driver Rick Morris made a rare mistake while Stephens was in the process of passing him around the outside at Clearways.\nTelitz, 22, from Birchwood, Wis., put on another clinic during his Semi Final round. He made an exemplary start from the pole and led all 15 laps to ensure a place on the front row of the grid for the 20-lap Grand Final. He had to be content with the outside position, due to the fact his Semi Final had been interrupted by two Safety Car periods which ensured a slower average speed than Semi Final 2. Undeterred, Telitz made a good start and immediately began to pressurize race leader Jonny McMullan.\nOn Lap 4, Telitz carried more momentum onto the Brabham Straight and drafted to the left of McMullan on the undulating approach to the first corner, Paddock Hill Bend. The pair ran side-by-side toward the apex of the turn, whereupon Telitz\u2019s car just got away from him and he performed a lazy spin into the gravel trap, from which there was no escape.\nTelitz and Stephens will now regroup and return to action on Thursday at Silverstone for two more days of testing prior to next weekend\u2019s Walter Hayes Trophy event for which over 100 Formula Ford cars are currently entered.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T13:26:10Z", "url": "http://www.f1600series.com/news/955-telitz-stars-for-team-usa-scholarship-at-the-formula-ford-festival.html", "byte_size": 1809, "char_size": 1803}

{"text": "Many years ago, Sony introduced a product named the Walkman which had revolutionized the way on how the public listened to music. After this, Apple created the iPod which was the next big invention of the century since it transformed the realm of portable music machines.\nDue to all the inventions that were created decades ago along with the advancements made in technology contemporarily; we are now breathing the age of the best Bluetooth speakers or rather, the best Bluetooth speakers priced under 5000.\nFor most of us, experiencing a high sound quality is mandatory in order to savor the tunes of our most favorable music. These days, tablets and smartphones are convenient to carry and play music wherever we go, although, in several scenarios, they are not proficient in delivering the sound quality we desire.\nTherefore, we look towards stand-alone speakers since they offer superb audio quality. But, there are certain limitations that come with it. In a nutshell, they are bulky, wired, weighty and require a power source. Because of this concern, the revolution of Bluetooth portable speakers has made it so much easier and seamless to listen to the music we desire.\nThe Bluetooth speakers provide a reliable and effective answer to this issue since they are extremely portable and you don\u2019t need to carry multiple cables wherever you go.\nMoreover, a portable Bluetooth speaker is an accessory that is certainly beneficial to own for both your laptop and smartphone but selecting one can often be challenging. With the multitude of options found in the market, it\u2019s difficult to choose the best one. There are models that range from different sizes and shapes.\nThe best method when it comes to selecting a speaker that\u2019s ideal for you is not only testing the sound but to see how suitable a speaker is by just reading through the specifications.\nNevertheless, in contrast to smartphones, users don\u2019t have the liberty always to try the product out before purchasing it in grand shopping malls. The solution to this problem is to pre-plan and know what to search for in a Bluetooth speaker. This will help you figure out all your needs and requirements before you make the final choice.\nFortunately for you, we\u2019ve put together a small review buying guide which will help you checklist features, aspects and review the best Bluetooth speakers under 5000 in India before purchasing the next best Bluetooth speaker. These products are affordable for all the users and come with stunning features.\nWhy Should I Pick A Bluetooth Speaker?\nBefore we move ahead with the product reviews, we need to understand (briefly) on what a wireless speaker does and why you should select a Bluetooth speaker so that you have a better grasp on the fundamentals before making an informed decision.\nWireless speakers have the capability to enable users to link their music players without requiring the need for many cables. In order to perform this feature, users will need to connect their devices such as a tablet, mobile, computer etc with a loudspeaker by utilizing any of the current connection technologies i.e Wi-Fi, personal wireless network, NFC (Near Field Communication) or Bluetooth.\nWifi speakers (a type of wireless speakers) require the wifi internet network in order to set up a connection. This connection offers authentic sound quality than compared to Bluetooth, however, when it comes to mini portable speakers, this is not a huge concern.\nIn contrast, they have multiple drawbacks. For instance, they require an initial configuration which can be quite complex for those users who are not knowledgeable with the technology.\nOr, if a user\u2019s domestic connection is not effective or strong, he/she may need to endure frequent connectivity issues. Apart from this, the main disadvantage for a Wi-Fi speaker is to always be situated near a plug in order to use it. This can be quite cumbersome for you on a regular basis.\nMoreover, there are quite a few wireless speakers such as Apple and Sonos machines that resolve connectivity issues by generating their own wireless network via an external device. Nonetheless, they still have the downside of requiring a connection to the electricity network.\nSo far, we have seen how a Wi-Fi speaker (as an example) seems to be quite complicated especially when it comes to integrating speakers with the wireless network.\nTherefore, if you\u2019re a user who is searching for easement of a super-simple speaker that can be easy to configure and carry around at the same time, we recommend opting for a portable Bluetooth speaker since it is, without a doubt, the best option.\nRegardless of where you are i.e at the pool, beach or maybe driving with friends, watching a show on your device, making a barbecue or in the patio of your household having dinner, a portable Bluetooth speaker will bring you amazing sound quality in the most soothing way possible.\nAs stated before, it\u2019s not suitable to construct your buying decision solely on specifications alone but it\u2019s the right place to begin, especially if you don\u2019t have the opportunity to obtain an audition test in order to test out the speaker yourself.\nWhen it comes to Bluetooth technology, you can analyze the audio transmission quality by measuring the distance kept between your smartphone and the speaker. Ideally, it\u2019s suggested to search for a Bluetooth 4 version or something more advanced since this version (minimum) includes a better battery life expectancy, assistance for Low Energy profile, and is about 60 meters.\nOn the other hand, Bluetooth 5 is the advanced and latest standard these days. It enhances the data transmission range and rate tremendously, however, not a lot of speakers adopt this standard.\nResponse from a frequency level is measured in hertz is usually outlined within a range of 100Hz \u2013 20,000Hz. The typical theory for frequency response is that \u2013 the wider the range, the better the speaker\u2019s ability to generate audio as it was expected.\nAlthough, implementing a wide range only doesn\u2019t deliver an appropriate sound quality since it all depends on how the ear discerns sound and this can differ significantly from one user to another.\nThere are other factors such as the listener\u2019s age since the ability to listen to particular frequencies tend to decrease over time. For example, in an audio file, the bass is generally heard at an approximate frequency range of 20Hz to 250Hz. Vocals along with other musical instruments such as piano and guitar tend to dwell in the range of 250Hz to 4000Hz. This range is usually identified as the mid-range. Treble is formed from the remaining frequencies that range up to 20,000Hz.\nApart from wireless connectivity, it\u2019s always great to have the choice open for a wired connection as well so you should look into an auxiliary connector. Generally, this is known as \u2018Aux-In\u2019 and is found in a speaker\u2019s specifications page. A wired connection is always beneficial for those users to aim to conserve a bit of their phone\u2019s battery or speaker and it definitely assists in obtaining better sound quality sometimes.\nA majority of speakers these days integrate NFC, which provides instant pairing with multiple devices. A microphone is also a fantastic feature to experience since it allows you to answer calls through the speaker directly which is quite similar to a speakerphone.\nWith this, you don\u2019t have to keep searching for your phone whenever you receive a call because you can answer directly via the speaker. Using a microphone even enables you to interact with the virtual assistant embedded into your phone. Therefore, you can easily inquire about the weather update and schedule appointments without touching your phone.\nAs CPU is the heart of a computer, the driver is the heart and soul of the best Bluetooth speakers under 5000 or any other speakers in general. This is why it\u2019s crucial to check out a driver that\u2019s decently sized. A majority of portable speakers will generally integrate a 40mm driver which is a recommendable size, to begin with. If you expect bigger drivers, then you should anticipate the fact that the overall speaker size will increase too.\nThe number of drivers along with their placements creates a huge impact on how the speaker will sound. Bluetooth speakers that are small in size usually come with an independent, full-range driver and are faced either upwards or downwards so that the oust sound is better.\nA lot of speakers even incorporate a twin driver setup which performs on a louder basis than compared to its counterparts. Due to insufficient space inside a portable Bluetooth speaker, a woofer can\u2019t be implemented. Therefore, many manufacturers install in passive radiators that vibrate in order to produce bass.\nIt\u2019s quite common to have a conventional USB charging port since it is an additional convenience for the user. This is true for those who regularly go outdoors or spend time at a relative/friends place but often forget to bring the bundled cables with them. Many speakers, currently, are interested in a Micro-USB port. This port opens the possibility to charge speakers with power banks thereby you don\u2019t need to be near a wall socket whenever you need to charge it.\n6) Where Will You Utilize A Bluetooth Speaker The Most?\nApart from its charging capabilities, you need to ponder upon how and where you\u2019ll be using the Bluetooth speaker. If the speaker is mostly for home use, then we recommend you to consider options that will combine well with your home interiors. The Bose SoundLink Revolve, for instance, is built with an aluminum body and includes a modern design. This is suitable and brilliant for any urban living room.\nHowever, if you aim to use the speaker outdoor or in the shower mostly, then we suggest you search for a sturdy, waterproof speaker. The best Bluetooth speakers under 5000 in India offer decent options within an affordable price range.\nAs mentioned before, battery life is important to evaluate. If you go out camping or commute for long periods of time, you need a good battery source since it is highly unlikely to gain access to a power source unless you\u2019re in a shop.\nA great number of Bluetooth speakers today can perform a lot more than streaming music in general. Intelligent speakers are now the latest trend in the industry and it\u2019s quite obvious to see how some of these models are paving their path into India.\nFor example, ALEXA \u2013 Amazon\u2019s virtual assistant is now integrated into Echo\u2019s line of wireless and wired speakers in India whereas Google has its own dedicated smart speakers.\nOther than sound, there are a plethora of features to try out and you should check to see whether or not it has companion app support. This is convenient if you desire to check the battery life of a speaker, control several speakers, or just simply update the firmware of a speaker.\nIf you\u2019re that user who hears high-resolution audio files most of the time, then it\u2019s exceptionally useful to obtain high-resolution audio profile support such as LDAC or aptX HD. These profiles make a whole lot of if only you use it with a compatible device and the right audio source.\nFinally, one other reliable feature we like to mention is the capability to pair several speakers together in order to generate a bigger sound. Often times, a single speaker isn\u2019t enough when it comes to loudness or rather \u2018fill\u2019 a huge room or when you\u2019re outdoors. This is why pairing two or more speakers of the same type is a perk you need to take advantage off.\nMany brands include this feature in their Bluetooth models and certain brands such as JBL allow you to link up 100 speakers and more together even though it\u2019s not necessary for you to utilize that many. Actually, users will only use the option to link two speakers in stereo mode, thus delivering them a much advanced audio experience.\nWith a few simple guidelines like these, it should now be less-challenging to narrow down your options when it comes to selecting a Bluetooth speaker that fits your hearing interest the best.\nAs we have seen some of the pivotal factors when it comes to deciding a worthy Bluetooth speaker, let\u2019s take a look at some tips on how to choose the best Bluetooth speaker under 5000 in India.\nChecking out the sound quality is without a doubt one of the most crucial parameters. Ultimately, if you are going to purchase a loudspeaker, then you should search for a model that will allow you to listen to music on an advanced standard than compared to listening to music on mobile.\nBut to be clear, how do I figure out which device outputs a good or decent sound quality? Technically, there are 4 parameters that\u2019ll make you realize which Bluetooth speaker will sound best, despite not hearing it before: sound system, output power, impedance, and frequency range.\nThe first point to evaluate is the type of sound system employed. Each of these systems comprises a particular amount of channels. Speakers can be integrated with a certain channel, therefore, allowing it to emit sounds. You might have heard about 2.1, 5.1 and many more versions. 5.1, for example, consists of a single subwoofer for bass and 5 full range speakers.\nMany Bluetooth speakers these days implement either 2.0 system which contains two full-range speakers or a 2.1 system (including subwoofer) which is known to behave the highest quality in terms of sound performance.\nThe second parameter is the output power (measured in watts). This value basically relates to the watts outputted by the loudspeaker. Moreover, it will cause sound pressures in decibels which is none other than the volume.\nMost of the Bluetooth speakers mentioned in this article are small in size thereby cannot generate a lot of power. Typically, you can expect power to range between 15 and 20 watts which should sufficient enough to get about 80 dB. This volume is loud enough in order to hear well in environments that are either outdoors or large in size.\nHowever, it\u2019s still recommended to not crank up the loudspeaker to its maximum power because it can lead to distortions. Usually, it\u2019s recommended to use an optimal power of 80%.\nOne another parameter that dictates the quality of sound is the resistance (measured in ohms). This parameter is connected to the power parameter and is linked with the passage of electric currents.\nThe golden rule is the higher the resistance, the lesser the power of which a speaker produces. To put it in simple terms, just note that the lower the impedance level, the superior the sound quality.\nThe last parameter to ponder about is the frequency range of which the machine is potent in emitting. The common audible spectrum, or the sounds that can be heard by the human ear, range on an estimate between 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.\nIf a Bluetooth wireless speaker is not competent of producing within the whole range of the audible spectrum, then there will be multiple sounds that will be missed.\nThereby, by having a substantial range of frequencies that are engulfed by the Bluetooth speaker, users can experience and perceive a much better sound.\nImagine a scenario where you need to get away for the weekend or go camping with your friends but your bag is too tight to fit into a huge speaker. Well, with a compact and lightweight Bluetooth speaker, this will not be such a problem.\nA lot of manufacturers have created a line of extremely compact and lightweight Bluetooth speaker models that can be placed anywhere in your luggage.\nThe best Bluetooth speakers under 5000 in India can be carried anywhere without you worrying about the load. If your aim is to own a portable speaker which allows you to take it wherever you commute, then pick a model that does not exceed more than 15 cm in terms of size.\nMany contemporary speakers in the market are packed with advanced Bluetooth versions such as Bluetooth 4.0 or 5.0. If your transmitting device of which you are going to use to connect is a \u2018dinosaur\u2019 version, then it is quite possible of you experiencing a connecting problem.\nThat is why we should make sure whether or not the speaker is compatible with older versions of Bluetooth (up to the A2DP) in order to prevent dismay.\nA lot of brands integrate their speakers with either a micro USB or USB output connection so that it is capable of charging the machine when needed. In addition, there are some instances where a user would need to install in the latest updates, therefore, prevent further compatibility issues.\nThere are few models that include batteries and enable up to 10 hours (maximum) of music playback \u2013 within a direct, single charge. Generally, a Bluetooth speaker should offer music playback for at least 6 hours. The charging period is another point to consider. There are few models that promote a quick charging feature whereas some models don\u2019t.\nHave you planned out where you\u2019re going to place the Bluetooth speaker at home? Fortunately, the best Bluetooth speakers under 5000 don\u2019t require a royal seat for showcasing.\nNevertheless, it is a compact and small device which tends to take up space as little as possible. If you wish to leave it in an area such as a table or a bookcase, then we suggest you pick a model that\u2019s equipped with a suitable design.\nAlthough, if you like to take it outdoors such as to a party or maybe to a beach, then you need a model that\u2019s covered with appealing colors in order to suit the mood and draw attention.\nMostly all brands deliver beautiful color combinations and you should pick one that fits your taste and personality.\nThis feature can\u2019t be seen in all Bluetooth wireless speakers but are much popular in Wi-Fi home speakers. If you wish to generate a better surrounding sound in a room, then a single speaker cannot do the trick since the source of the emitting sounds is discharged only from a single point. To combat this, you can add in additional speakers at multiple points.\nIn order to gain this versatility, there are a few Bluetooth units which have an app that enables you to manage the links and pairs between multiple speakers.\nApart from Bluetooth connectivity, you should give NFC a try. NFC makes the job of connecting devices much easier than expected. All you need to do is to basically bring the units closer, keep them at a range for a second or so and they will pair up automatically. But of course, you would need both your units to include an NFC system (both the tablet or phone along with the speaker).\nIn order to pair up your previous drives which don\u2019t have Bluetooth as an option, use a 3.5 mm auxiliary input since it will enable you to link devices by utilizing a cable.\nSadly, all of us live our lives in a hurry. Daily activities and tasks strive us to perform jobs instantly and we certainly don\u2019t find time for ourselves. Thus, if your speaker is easy to use and manage, you will find your hands filled with more time which can be used for other important tasks.\nHaving an easy-to-use speaker will not let you spend more than 5 minutes or so in reading instructions and understanding how to operate it. All you need to do is to switch it on, pair it and enjoy yourselves.\nMoreover, you just need to know a few controls found on the speaker because it will assist you in performing some simple functions. For instance, the volume control, the power button, a button to answer calls (if available), the play/pause button, and the Bluetooth pairing switch is all you need to know in order to obtain complete control of the device.\nIf you are hearing music on your speaker which is linked to your smartphone but surprisingly receive a call. What happens next? Well, if this speaker incorporates a microphone that\u2019s built-in, then you can easily speak in front of it as if it were a hands-free approach.\nThe music is paused, and you can answer your call by tapping on the speaker\u2019s button. Furthermore, once you\u2019re done with the call, the music continues to play. This can come in handy for most of the users.\nWhen it comes to durability, it\u2019s best to research and read through online reviews, forums before purchasing the product. If you are one of those users who frequently drop their belongings (phone, tablet etc), it will be beneficial to obtain a speaker that\u2019s sturdy and strong enough to withstand potential damage.\nAdditionally, few Bluetooth speaker models are constructed with aluminum housings which are practically more resistant than compared to the typical plastic material. If you drop it, by chance, it will still not break due to its aluminum housing construction.\nThis is the final tip we can give you folks. You should carefully think about why you should purchase a Bluetooth speaker. Do you wish to position it in places at home, is it for parties and outdoor adventures or rather do you wish for something that\u2019s waterproof?\nFortunately, there are multiple models out there that serve different purposes so you should choose smartly.\nYou should make it clear on where you\u2019ll be using the speaker. If you take it with you for camping adventures or to a barbecue then you should be prepared for it.\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re going to utilize it for mainly exterior purposes then pick a model that provides a high sound and emits remarkable output power. This will allow you to listen to music with clarity even though the environments are noisy. Even so, the model should not produce less than 85 decibels optimal power.\nAnother aspect you should consider, especially in this case, is the battery capacity. We mentioned this before, but you need to have at least 6-10 hours of music playback. If suppose the speaker is massive, the unit will come with a sturdy yet comfortable handle. This is helpful since you can carry it anywhere comfortably in your hand for long periods of time.\nLastly, search for a model that\u2019s water resistant since an accident can occur when you\u2019re in a party, at the beach or any environment that\u2019s wet.\nThe all-new Creative Sound portable speaker allows you to roam freely outdoors while listening to your favorite tunes.

This model even features an effortless mp3 music playback system that enables continuous music operation.\nIn the end, this device offers listeners with a variety of options along with information which is produced in clear, muddle-free sound quality.\nThe Denon Enyaya speaker is an upgraded version of the popular Denon speaker model.

{"text": "Unmanned vehicles (commonly called \"drones\") are a crucial tool in the modern intelligence arsenal. Drones can gather still or video images, track targets from tens of thousands of feet in the air, and carry deadly payloads for when force is unavoidable.\nIn the right GUMSHOE games\u2014mainly Night's Black Agents, though GMs may make them available in Esoterrorists or more cinematic Mutant City Blues campaigns\u2014a drone serves as a source of clues for investigative abilities like Electronic Surveillance, Military Science, Photography, and even Traffic Analysis. Information from a drone can be downloaded and analyzed in nearly real-time, making an unmanned vehicle a potential source of tactical fact-finding and tag-team tactical benefits.\nEventually, an agent may want to take more active control of a drone. The most important general ability is obviously Piloting (or Driving for ground drones), which works exactly as if the agent were flying in person. (Double Tap notes that mastering a type drone takes up one Piloting vehicle slot or a Driving slot for remote ground vehicles.) An armed drone allows the use of Shooting, and may carry the equivalent of a submachine gun (+1 damage) all the way up to Hellfire missiles (class 5 explosives). Drones can also be a platform for Surveillance tests to observe or track distant targets.\nIn spy thrillers, most drones are sophisticated enough to operate for long periods of time without direct control by a human operator.

{"text": "Show of hands for everyone that's been confused by the relationship between Wes and Annalise on How to Get Away with Murder . Since the first episode of the series, Annalise has taken a liking to Wes and no one knows why. Is Wes Annalise's son? Is Annalise attracted to Wes? A lot of theories have been thrown out into the ring. On Thursday's episode of HTGAWM, Annalise told Eve \"it's him\" when speaking about Wes, so basically I'm taking that as a big thumbs up on the mother/son relationship, even though that seems too easy for a show this convoluted.\nDuring an intimate scene between Eve and Annalise, who go way back, Eve questions why Annalise is protecting Wes, who is just a student. Annalise tells Eve that Wes is not just some student. \"It's him,\" Annalise tells Eve, who immediately knows what she's talking about. You know who doesn't know what she's talking about? Me. And everyone else in this world who is too emotionally and mentally invested in this god forsaken show.\nEve tells Annalise that she is a very good person, making it seem like whatever secret correlation Wes and Annalise have has caused distress on Annalise. So all signs point to Wes being Annalise's son. But, how does that fit into Wes' life timeline? We know that Wes had a rough start as a kid. He didn't have a father in his life and his mother killed herself when he was a young teen, but what if Annalise's connection to Wes comes before all of that?\nOne Reddit user believes that Annalise could be Wes' biological mother, but gave him up for adoption as a baby because she got pregnant at a high point in her career where she didn't want to take care of a baby. Now, she brought him back into her life the only way Annalise Keating knows how (manipulation, power, etc.) and is finally being the mother figure she never got to be for him. It's a stretch, but it's also possible with the few clues we have been given.\nMy only concern with the mother theory is that it almost seems too easy. For a while, people have been speculating that Wes and Annalise are related. Hell, I think one of the other students made a joke about it at one point. Because of this, I'm not sure if the producers would write in such an expected storyline. They're so good at steering their viewers one way with bait, and then switching directions at the last second.

NWN, HHR, Moribund, Red Stream and more to have copies shortly.\nWhen comes the vinyls for \"War of All Against All\" and \"Beheaded Ouroboros\"?\nI must say this Diocletian album it's probably one of the most bestial and obscure pieces of Metal that i've ever heard.\nVinyl is a while off yet. Let the CDs permeate first but vinyl will come at some stage in the first half of 2011 I imagine. All things going to plan. This time we'll do the vinyl for Witchrist and Diocletian through Invictus, Iron Bonehead & Parasitic in the US so US customers can order directly from within the states.\nnice will ask sham to buy the cd for me.he going to ireland this december.\nWill have to pick up the cds for now.\nAll companies will have the same colour and not different colours right?\nKiller record! I think this is better than Doom Cult. The mix is more crushing and less muddy, but probable even more heavy. I think the drums are a bit clearer and it makes it sound even more brutal. Glad this came out before the LA gig.\nthe sound on this thing is CRUSHING, definitely an improvement on Doom Cult (which sounded excellent in its own right).

{"text": "Cycling by nature is repetitive, requiring being in a fixed, and often quite flexed position, for long periods of time. Mobility, strength and stability are therefore crucial to not having to compromise on position and to generating maximum power. Trunk control and strength through the abdominals and obliques is therefore essential to holding a good posture on the bike, which in turn helps with efficiency \u2013 if you\u2019re not stable in your core it doesn\u2019t matter how strong your legs are, you\u2019re going to be rocking around and wasting energy.\nStrength conditioning programmes are also important. You lose strength quickly when you haven\u2019t ridden for a while \u2013 something that tends to happen a lot over the winter \u2013 but strength conditioning helps minimise the loss of riding miles. Alongside that, stretching is important for mobility and flexibility, helping recovery and regeneration, a kind of general maintenance really.\nHaving a programme that incorporates these things alongside your normal riding timetable will therefore be beneficial for both performance and injury prevention. For example, look to incorporate two or three strength and conditioning sessions into your week, on the days when you\u2019re not riding. Then look to do 10 minutes of stretching either side of a ride or session, though I don\u2019t advise you do hard stretching after exercise, as you don\u2019t want to inflict more damage on the muscles you\u2019ve just been working.\nA programme of 12 weeks is optimum, but you\u2019ll see improvements in four to six weeks, or with some exercises even sooner. Some things like muscle lengthening can take longer, but as with everything perseverance will pay off.\nSo what are you waiting for? Give us a call to make an appointment with John or Phil Smith to ensure you\u2019re fighting fit for spring!", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T07:49:49Z", "url": "http://www.physiohaus.co.uk/blog/strength-training-for-cyclists-by-john-dennis", "byte_size": 1821, "char_size": 1795}

Are the \u201cmineral rights intact?\u201d \u201cWill there be an oil well pump jack in my front yard?\u201d The purpose of this post is to arm you with the basic knowledge to answer these questions and to take the confusion out of your transaction.\nAn oil and gas lease is like a surface lease in that the owner gives the right to use real estate for a period of time in exchange for payment. Therefore, the owner is giving the right to another person (typically an oil and gas company) to explore and produce oil from the subsurface for a period of time. Most oil and gas leases in Kansas range from five to ten years unless production or exploration is active. If production or exploration is active, an oil and gas lease continues until such time as it is inactive for the term of the lease. Interestingly, the vast majority of real estate subject to an oil and gas lease is never explored. Companies purchase the lease and in the event oil and gas is found in the area, they can continue the exploration and production.\nA title insurance company will list the oil and gas lease on a commitment to make the buyer aware of the fact that a lease exists on the real estate; that somebody potentially has the right to drill an oil well or place an oil well in your front yard. Quite often though, the lease period has expired and no oil has been produced. If this is the case, and somebody familiar with the land will swear to this fact, the exception can be removed from the commitment.\nOil and gas rights can be a complicated subject for even the most seasoned buyer, seller, real estate agent or banker.

I love Christmas so much that I tend to get so excited for it, and phase over Thanksgiving. I do this, but in all reality, I have a great deal to be thankful for.\nI have a big MOMMY FAIL to admit. I'm sure I'm not the only one out there. I can't be. The teacher in me is surprised at myself actually. But here it is.\nCrochet Tiger Hat Pattern - FREE!!!\nIf you have a preschooler, you have probably heard of the infamous Daniel Tiger. I have to admit, it's actually a really cute show. The song is catchy, and an homage to the well loved \"Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.\" There are not many patterns out there for this adorable character so I decided to make one up on my own.\nAre you trying to find a new sitter? Are you trying to figure out some good questions to ask? Everybody's situation is always a little different but maybe my questions will help you out.\nMy 21 month old son was sick last week. He had a low fever the first 3 days of which I really didn't even notice unless I was hugging him because his body was so HOT. He acted fine though! He was running around and eating like nothing was wrong. I called and the nurse line at the doctors office and they said to call back in a few days if he still has it. The nurse just said he was fighting something off and it's body is doing what it needs to. I could give a little tylenol or ibuprofen to help the fever, but there wasn't any concern at all.\nHow cute is this little unicorn? I had a customer ask me if I could make one for her and she showed me a few pictures of what she was looking for. She wanted something small enough to go on top of a diaper cake, but still big enough for a baby to grow and cuddle with. This is what I came up with. I don't often share patterns like this for free, but it's just so cute that I wanted everyone else to enjoy in the magic of this Unicorn! So here's my FREE Crocheted Unicorn Pattern. If you would like to buy this already made you can here at MY STORE.\nI love watching Shark Tank. It's a great show. I always tend to put myself in the seats of the judges. Would I bite on that business or not? There are definitely some that make me wonder how they even got on the show though. Like the other day I saw one with a fake phone. They said its the Pet Rock of our time. I mean really? Mostly, though, I'm sitting there thinking, \"Why didn't I think of that?\", or \" What can I create?\" These entrepreneurs just found a problem, and solved it with new items.\nI love these crochet memes. I'm just going to leave them right here so you can enjoy them all as well!\nIn a previous post I talked about our decision of trying to cut out as much sugar as possible from our diets. One of our favorite meals has been Nachos. We don't look at the calories anymore, just the sugar intake. You can purchase all these ingredients with no sugar, you just have to look. I can buy all this stuff at our local grocery store, but if for some reason you cant, then any of the \"organic\" type stores (Lucky's, Trader Joes, etc..) should have them. Even my extremely picky 7 year old loves this meal!\nProud Mama: No more pull-ups!\nI'm pretty laid back when it comes to potty training. At least I have been with my middle child, Lilly. I had my third baby when she was 2.5 so although it would have been nice to have her in underwear, I really did not have the time, or energy, to get her potty trained.\nWe tried here and there at first, and she kept having accidents. Finally, she was pretty much potty trained soon after she turned 3, and was entering school. From day 1 at school, she was in underwear. The teachers were fine with it which was great. She had a few weeks where she had a couple of accidents, but soon we were finally there.\nA while ago, my husband and I went to see Kevin Smith at a comedy show. He was there to make people laugh, of course, but surprisingly, he also made people think about their health. He took us on his journey of weight loss. I don't know if you've noticed, but he has lost quite a bit of weight! It was pretty simple how he did it too. He stopped eating sugar. That's it. Taking sugar out of his diet made him a healthier, leaner person.\nBeing a stay at home mom is great! I love being with my babies, and being able to take care of all of the family stuff.\nI try to help make a little money any way I can to help out. I'm pretty busy throughout the day with one thing or another, so I needed to find something that I can pick up at any time of the day to work on. I have my crocheting business, but sometimes, when it's slower, I wanted to have something else that I could do.\nFREE Mickey Mouse Glove Applique Crochet Pattern!!\nRecently, I've been making different characters into Easter/Halloween baskets. I have an order for a Mickey Mouse one and I wanted to add some gloves to it. I went to look for a basic pattern to guide me, but there were no patterns for crocheted Mickey Mouse glove appliques. So I decided to whip some up and post the free pattern here for anyone else who may need some! Enjoy!\nI feel like I should be playing Eminem's \"Cleaning Out My Closet\" as I write this.\nI think that song would be too short for how long this took though. SO, as I mentioned in a previous post, I bought a lot of overstock on bathroom items at a closing grocery store the other day.\nThe problem, though, is that I didn't have any space for them!\nWe have a grocery store in our area called Marsh. It is by far the least shopped at store, and surprisingly we had two in our town. Kroger, Target, Walmart, and the plethora of whole food type stores definitely have covered the grocery market in our town. Why we had two Marshes is beyond me. Not surprisingly, one of them recently announced that they were going to close down, and all of a sudden, the parking lot was packed!!\nOn my way to becoming a teacher again!\nI passed my Teacher exams!!\nI love to crochet. Obviously, I am The Crocheting Mom after all! Up until recently though, I've gotten my patterns from other people. Then I started to figure out my own way to make things, but never really wrote it down. I've had people ask me before for my patterns, but they were written in scribbles, or my notes on the computer, in a sequence that only I would be able to understand. Until now. These past few months I've started to create my own patterns.\nFor me, having one baby was easy. Then, the transition from one child to two children was also extremely do-able.

{"text": "Home Health What If My Medical Packaging Is Defective?\nIt\u2019s frustrating to receive shipments of medical products back that have been deemed unsafe or unfit for sale due to packaging failures. The cause can be something that is not easy to detect. It\u2019s times like this that the value of professional and expert medical product package testing is most obvious.\nMedical packaging can fail for many reasons. It can be due to faulty packaging processes, poor materials, ineffective seals, or failed design. Finding out that your packaging will not stand up to shipping, shelving, and storage can prove costly. Having tons of product sent back that can no longer be placed on the market is a waste of resources and lost revenue.\nYou\u2019ll need to have your current packaging fully tested to find the exact cause of failure. It might seem obvious, but there can be lurking problems that only professional testing can find. It\u2019s the best way to find a starting point and determine how to move forward.\nUltimately, you\u2019ll need to have an expert medical packaging consultant help you come up with a different design, or materials choice to create packaging that meets the rigors and requirements of the market. You can get the advice you need that will produce the results without any further delays in getting your products out there to the consumers.\nAny new package designs should be put through the same rigorous testing to ensure it\u2019s the solution. All types of testing can be done to simulate transport, storage, temperature variances, or vibration. You can even have leak detection and artificial aging processes tested successfully.\nThe goal of medical package testing is to come up with answers when there are problems, monitor processes for problems, and develop solutions when there are troubles. Invest in professional packaging testing any time you suffer a setback due to packaging failures.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T14:38:07Z", "url": "http://www.grameen-bank.net/what-if-my-medical-packaging-is-defective/", "byte_size": 1904, "char_size": 1892}
{"text": "How do companies innovate with big data? It starts with human-centered design thinking.\nAs the mom of a toddler, I spend most of my waking hours covered in a mixture of applesauce, milk, and general baby-themed liquids.\nBut it turns out, there are some clever ways to innovate with big data going on here. Coming from the 100-year-old clothing company L.L. Bean.\nL.L. Bean has teamed up with a variety of tech companies so that they can track data on how their garments are really used on an ongoing basis. Like how often each item is worn when it\u2019s washed, the temperature outside when worn, and more. Over the years, it will also show if an older garment is being used again, indicating a return to fashion.\nTheir key partner is Loomia, who makes flexible circuitry so the clothes can be fitted with sensors. Customers then have to agree to release their data to the blockchain, along with some basic information about their demographics like age, gender, and so on. The blockchain will be set up to keep this information anonymous.\nWell, it will probably work like a reward card system, whereby agreeing to give your usage data to the brand, you get free shipping or discounts. We\u2019ve seen this work many times. So, as long as the interface is really easy to use, people will happily release their data for free stuff\u2026we like free stuff!\nRight now, this data will be mainly used to innovate with big data and drive product improvements. By seeing what\u2019s being worn, how, where and by who, L.L. Bean will be able to leverage this information into the next round of clothing they create.\nThey will be able to see what types of usage reduce the lifespan or quality of the product. And then, either try to add protection against this use or just create a new line for that type of customer.\nSo, expect L.L. Bean to have a new line of \u201csweaters that your dog can sleep on\u201d and \u201cnon-wash pizza repellent shirts\u201d. One can only dream.\nHowever, this type of long-term data analysis is just the beginning. Smart clothing has a lot more applications than this.\nIf your jacket can sense the weather, then there\u2019s no reason that it can\u2019t react to it in some way too. And, unlike some internet of things devices, if you lose connection, it\u2019s not going to stop working as a jacket. This can all act as a bonus feature, rather than something integral to the functioning of the garment.\nBecause you don\u2019t want people getting soaked in the rain just because they lost WiFi, right?\nThere are many more ways to innovate with big data beyond this.\nIf you want to learn more about how you can leverage big data to inspire new products and services, then we\u2019ll be diving deeper into this innovative approach in our next video.\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I just need to find the remote control for my shirt.\nHow Can Big Data Drive Innovation?\nToday, we\u2019re going to see how to innovate with big data, especially when it\u2019s combined with a certain way of thinking.\nBecause data on its own is just a raw material. It\u2019s like having a ton of flour \u2013 it has value, but it\u2019s worth so much more when you turn it into a cake. Yummmmm, cake.\nSo, what can you bake from big data? The answer lies in the additional ingredient, design thinking.\nDesign thinking, born from the folks at international design firm IDEO, is a method of meeting people\u2019s needs and desires in a technologically feasible and strategically viable way.\nYou start by looking at what the customer needs. Rather than SOLELY focusing on profit margins and bottom line. You don\u2019t ignore these important factors, of course, that\u2019s just bad business sense. But in design thinking, you start with the customer needs and build from there.\nBig data, vs. survey data, is the information about people\u2019s actual behavior rather than what they believe their behavior is. This opens up the opportunity for real, groundbreaking innovation. Applied in the right way, this can unlock the real human-centered problem.\nFor L.L. Bean, collecting information like how often a jacket is worn, washed, or the temperature of the climate is the little data breadcrumbs that we leave behind as we live our lives.\nThe company can then follow the breadcrumbs to understand more about our behaviors. This is more telling than what you fill out in a survey or post on social media. It\u2019s beyond the \u201cedited\u201d response and rooted in real life activities.\nBut trying to innovate with big data is not just for big brands.\nYou might not have an army of customers wearing your brand\u2019s sci-fi pants, sending data to a cloud, but there are ways you can collect vital information.\nEven if you aren\u2019t an engineer or well-versed in mining big data, you can still practice using big data with design thinking.\nThe most obvious place to start is using website data from Google Analytics to objectively show the most important behavior patterns of users on a website. Once you understand what people are doing, you can work out why, and use this to find innovative solutions.\nIf you don\u2019t have your own website, don\u2019t despair, Google has a demo google analytics account available to everyone.\nAnd even though it\u2019s a demo, the data comes from the real Google Merchandise Store, which sells Google-branded merch. It\u2019s real numbers and real customer behaviors!\nYou can learn to apply your favorite algorithm, find valuable behavior insights, and all about the customer\u2019s needs through big data.\nBig data must be treated as the asset, not the byproduct.

{"text": "The SNP's internal feud reached new depths of bitterness last night when party leader Alex Salmond was told by treasurer Ian Blackford to apologise for criticisms made last week or face being sued for defamation.\nAs moves continued to oust Mr Blackford, the party was also preparing disciplinary action against one of his closest allies, Ms Margo MacDonald, who faces accusations of breaking internal rules by publicly challenging a parliamentary group decision.\nMs MacDonald, a critic of Mr Salmond's leadership style, will be dealt with on Thursday at a meeting which her supporters claim could mark the start of a campaign to have her deselected.\nNationalist spokesmen desperately sought to play down the effects of the furious row which erupted between Mr Salmond and Mr Blackford last week over reports that the SNP was in deep financial trouble.\nPress officer Kevin Pringle refused to give details of the behind-the-scenes leadership attack on Mr Blackford at the weekend party executive meeting which passed a motion of no confidence in him by 18 votes to three.\nSNP rules allow the executive to admonish, suspend or expel a member - which some observers think could be the leadership's next move if Mr Blackford stays put.\nParty insiders have pointed privately to Mr Blackford as the source of recent stories about the SNP's financial state. Mr Blackford has hotly denied any wrongdoing. The cause of the row is Mr Blackford's reputedly hard line as treasurer in drawing up tough housekeeping rules for the party which is in debt.\nHe is thought privately to believe Mr Salmond and former chief executive Michael Russell, together spent irresponsibly during the Scottish Parliament elections and then left him to clear up the financial mess. Mr Blackford has repeatedly said that as a prominent and wealthy banker in Edinburgh he must ensure his conduct is above reproach because his professional reputation is on the line.\nThe latest dispute between the leader and treasurer involves the extent of the party's overdraft and the effectiveness of Mr Blackford's efforts to have it cleared before the General Election.\nHe and Mr Salmond were involved in an acrimonious dispute last summer after The Herald revealed that Stagecoach millionaire Brian Souter had made a major contribution - said to be about #200,000 - to the SNP but had not been named as the source. Rules at the time did not require the identity of major donors to be revealed but parties had agreed to abide by the spirit of the new procedures.\nMr Blackford irritated Mr Salmond, who claimed the SNP had behaved perfectly properly, with his insistence that there must be no ''jiggery pokery''.\nRelations between the two men have never recovered and hit a new low last week with newspaper claims that the SNP was broke and had been forced to sell its Edinburgh HQ to help pay off an overdraft believed to be #400,000.\nIn fact, the SNP had planned long ago to sell its offices. The party is believed to have struck an agreement on the sale last week and it must now find a new headquarters.\nProceeds from the sale are not expected to be used in clearing the overdraft which deputy party leader John Swinney predicted last month would be paid off around the end of this year and which was about #600,000 at its worst.\nMr Blackford, who is reputedly wealthy, told Radio Clyde that when he was involved in talks with his bank about personally helping the SNP out of its financial difficulty, Mr Salmond was encouraging former party leader Willie Wolfe to run against him as treasurer. Mr Wolfe subsequently withdrew. ''I don't need lessons from Alex Salmond on integrity or trust,'' Mr Blackford said.\nThe SNP would not confirm a report that Mr Salmond accused Mr Blackford of incompetence and of destabilising the party and had appeared to blame him for the overspend.\nHe rejected suggestions that he and allies like Ms MacDonald were being purged as an offensive against dissidents. ''I don't believe in conspiracy theories,'' he said.\nMr Blackford pointed out that his treasurer's report to the national council last month had been accepted without questioning.\nMs MacDonald incurred the wrath of the leadership when she complained publicly about the parliamentary party's refusal to set aside SNP debating time in the chamber for her ideas for exploring the use of cannabis, particularly as an aid to those suffering pain. She accused some of her colleagues of ''reneging'' on the issue.\nbetween the leader and treasurer.\nLabour revelled in the SNP disarray. Scotland Office Minister Brian Wilson said: ''Alex Salmond's control freak tendencies have finally come home to roost. Having ousted the party treasurer in the night of the long sgian dubhs he has now turned his sights on the independence-minded Margo MacDonald.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T16:10:41Z", "url": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12195953.bitter-feud-puts-snp-in-turmoil-treasurer-threatens-to-sue-party-leader-for-defamation-unless-salmond-apologises-for-remarks/", "byte_size": 4792, "char_size": 4792}

{"text": "On April 4, 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft. The small firm used to develop and sell BASIC interpreters. Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will become the biggest software firm in the world, and also bag the title for one of the most valuable companies.\nToday, there is a little bit of Microsoft in everybody\u2019s life. Whether it is the desktop computer where Microsoft\u2019s Windows has about 90 percent market share or the company\u2019s Office which is unarguably the best productivity suite available. Maybe you are into gaming and own an Xbox One, or your company relies on Azure cloud services.\nIn the last 40 years, Microsoft -- which once used to sell program language interpreters -- has expanded into several categories, and now makes full-fledged operating systems for not just desktop computers, but smartphones, gaming consoles, servers, as well as Internet of Things devices. Surface tablets and Xbox consoles show the company\u2019s side interest in developing its own hardware modules.\n\"Early on, Paul Allen and I set the goal of a computer on every desk and in every home. It was a bold idea and a lot of people thought we were out of our minds to imagine it was possible. It is amazing to think about how far computing has come since then, and we can all be proud of the role Microsoft played in that revolution\", Gates wrote in an email sent to all Microsoft employees yesterday.\n\"In the coming years, Microsoft has the opportunity to reach even more people and organizations around the world. Technology is still out of reach for many people, because it is complex or expensive, or they simply do not have access. So I hope you will think about what you can do to make the power of technology accessible to everyone, to connect people to each other, and make personal computing available everywhere even as the very notion of what a PC delivers makes its way into all devices\", Gates noted.\n\"Under Satya's leadership, Microsoft is better positioned than ever to lead these advances. We have the resources to drive and solve tough problems. We are engaged in every facet of modern computing and have the deepest commitment to research in the industry. In my role as technical advisor to Satya, I get to join product reviews and am impressed by the vision and talent I see. The result is evident in products like Cortana, Skype Translator, and HoloLens -- and those are just a few of the many innovations that are on the way\".\nAnd this attitude was the reason Windows Phone 7 -- arguably Microsoft's first real take on a mobile operating system-- wasn\u2019t released until 2010. By this time, iPhone had showed its dominance in the world, and Google was upping the ante with Android. Windows Phone is still struggling to gain any substantial market share. The mobile platform still has a wide \"app-gap\" problem, though the company seems to have found a couple of ways to fix it.\nBut one of the most exciting things that happened in the company was its decision to open up. Under Nadella, Microsoft finally accepted that it doesn\u2019t have a significant user base in smartphones. The company realized that if it didn't open up to rival platforms, it would miss out on a lot of users. And that\u2019s one of the first things Nadella did after taking the charge of the company. Microsoft launched Office on iOS. Until then Office was only available on Windows, Windows RT, and Windows Phone, and a half-baked mobile version on Android.\nThe move received an overwhelming response from users, resulting in Office apps -- Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- top the app chart in within 24 hours of their release on the platform. Late last year, the company made premium access to the Office suite free on iOS and Android. Office for iOS was in the works at Microsoft for a long time, but Ballmer used to prioritize its products on Windows devices first. Nadella evidently changed that.\n\"We have accomplished a lot together during our first 40 years and empowered countless businesses and people to realize their full potential. But what matters most now is what we do next\", Gates writes in his email. Microsoft does have a lot of things to look forward to in the coming months and years. Later this year, Microsoft will release Windows 10 for desktop computers, as well as smartphones, IoT devices and Xbox One. In the coming months, Microsoft will also release the next iteration of its productivity suite, Office 2016. For the first time, the company is simultaneously releasing Office on OS X and Windows.\nAdditionally, Microsoft has showcased a number of products that could change the way we compute and interact with technology. Its augmented reality headset HoloLens is just one example. It will be interesting to see what the company does next and how things work out for it in the coming years.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T04:54:20Z", "url": "https://betanews.com/2015/04/04/microsoft-at-40-more-open-bold-goes-where-users-are/", "byte_size": 4842, "char_size": 4828}

It is often a true David versus Goliath fight, one in which a single employee tries to take on huge and powerful corporations.\nTo encourage whistleblowers to file suits and help stop greed and fraud, the law allows whistleblowers to receive a cash award of up to 30% of what the government collects. Million dollar awards are common.\nIn addition to the awards, the law also protects whistleblowers from retaliation. The court can award double damages to an aggrieved employee.\nFinally, the False Claims Act provides that the whistleblowers\u2019 legal counsel can be awarded fees and costs. This is especially important when the lawyers must prosecute the case privately or spend years prosecuting retaliation claims.\nRecently the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals decided a case involving these counsel fees. For those not familiar, the 6th Circuit is the top federal appeals court covering Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Tennessee. Those of us who primarily represent whistleblowers don\u2019t always consider it the friendliest court but an opinion this month certainly shows that the court still appreciates whistleblowers and the need for counsel fees.\nIn 2014, Community Health Systems (CHS) agreed to pay $97 million to settle claims that the company engaged in medically unnecessary emergency admissions, illegally paid kickbacks to physicians who referred patients to the company\u2019s Laredo Medical Center and improperly billed for inpatient procedures. The case was actually the consolidation of several cases filed by whistleblowers.\nBecause all the alleged wrongdoing involved Medicare, the cases were brought under the federal False Claims Act. After the case settled, a dispute arose over the nearly 7,000 hours of billable time expended by the several law firms that were involved in the case.\n\u201cI write separately to address the purposes and goals of the False Claims Act, which set the perspective through which the courts (and the government) should view all FCA litigation.\n\u201cHealth care fraud is rampant in the United States. Some estimate that fraud costs Medicare and Medicaid between $30 billion and $98 billion annually. In one way or another, we all pay for this fraud through higher health insurance premiums, copayments, and taxes.\n\u201cThe FCA is one of the Government\u2019s most effective tools for combatting health care fraud. \u2018To date, the FCA has helped the government recover more fraudulently spent Medicare dollars than any other mechanism within the federal government.\u2019 (Joshua A. Levy, Lessons from the Private Enforcement of Health Care Fraud). In 2014, for instance, while the Government recovered only $454 million through the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 fraud prevention system, it recovered $2.3 billion from health care FCA cases. In addition, evidence provided by FCA whistleblowers has resulted in dozens of criminal convictions and administrative exclusions that otherwise may not have occurred.\n\u201cWithout a doubt, relators and their attorneys play a vital role in rooting out health care fraud and obtaining recovery of the public monies that were intended to be spent for providing health care to veterans and poor, elderly, and disabled citizens. Fostering such recoveries under the FCA must include recognition that theseactions are not without economic risks and other dangers to relators and their counsel. A relator takes very real risks in coming forward to report fraud\u2014an action that often includes obtaining and providing evidence against his/her employer that involves substantial sums of money and potential criminal liability. And providing that evidence is just the beginning. Attorneys then must undertake the substantial investigative work and expense of putting together a case for their relators then present it to government officials to determine if the government is willing to proceed with the litigation. Counsel routinely undertake this work without knowing whether other qui tam complaints have been filed under seal elsewhere. If the government decides that the information provided would be useful to it in vindicating society\u2019s interests, it may share information about other qui tam cases and create a group of counsel to do the work that is necessary to prosecute the case. This work often takes years during which the government runs the sealed case, including assigning tasks to various counsel and approaching the defendant about the claims and monetary settlement. To consummate any settlement it negotiates, the government intervenes in and unseals the qui tam complaints filed by relators on its behalf. Though the government\u2019s bargain sets the basic terms of the settlement agreement, the timetable, and resolves payment to the relators\u037e counsel are often left to negotiate the terms governing payment of attorney fees\u2014even for the considerable work accomplished by counsel at the government\u2019s behest. Much is at stake because these negotiations may determine whether a defendant\u2014which took public money through health care fraud\u2014must pay a relator\u2019s counsel for their work in forcing the return of that money. There are practical reasons for this framework but it also entails practical problems: negotiations are often rushed, counsel for the various relators may have differing opportunity to draft agreement terms, and they do not have the leverage that the government has.\nThe case is United States ex rel. Doghramji, (6th Cir. Nov. 22, 2016).\nIt is refreshing to see that courts truly appreciate the value that whistleblowers and their lawyers contribute to society and particularly the hardships that whistleblowers must endure when taking on a powerful company.\nWe are honored to represent whistleblowers and frequently humbled by the sacrifices they make to put a stop to greed, fraud and corruption. If you have inside information about such wrongdoing, you too may be entitled to an award.\nTo determine whether you may have a claim, give us a call.

{"text": " \u201cThe Funeral Director from the Dark Side\u201d was the introduction to an item broadcast on TV One\u2019s Close Up at 7.00pm on 7 June 2005. The item reported on the experiences of two women who were angered and disappointed by the way Wainuiomata undertaker, Darryl Angus, trading as Omega Funeral Services, had handled the funerals of family members.\n The item also included critical comment about Mr Angus from the Funeral Directors\u2019 Association of New Zealand. Mr Angus, it noted, was not a member of that Association.\n Peter Freedman complained to Television New Zealand Ltd, the broadcaster, that the item breached the standards relating to privacy, balance, accuracy and fairness.\n Explaining that he was a friend of Mr Angus, Mr Freedman said TVNZ was advised early on 7 June that Mr Angus, having taken legal advice, did not wish to participate in the programme. Nevertheless, TVNZ\u2019s film crew, travelling in a vehicle on which the TVNZ logo had been concealed, spent several hours that day trying to track him down. That included going to his home and filming it. It also involved attempting to film Mrs Angus through the window at the Wainuiomata Fire Station where she worked as a volunteer firefighter. Those efforts, Mr Freedman complained, breached the privacy principle which dealt with intentional interference in the nature of prying.\n In support of his contention that the item was unbalanced, Mr Freedman maintained that Close Up, despite Mr Angus\u2019s refusal to take part, was required to broadcast a balanced item. Complimentary letters from former clients of Mr Angus\u2019s Omega Funeral Services had been published in the local newspaper at the time of the recent controversy when he moved his business from an industrial to a retail area, Mr Freedman wrote.\n Other comment could have been obtained from the Police, from the website www.wainuiomata.com, or from Mr Angus himself if he had been approached informally.\n Mr Freedman said that the Anguses and Omega Funeral Services had also been subject to harassment from a small number of people for some weeks before the broadcast, but that matter was not disclosed.\n Mr Freedman argued that the item lacked impartiality as, with minimal evidence, it had referred to \u201cclaims of theft, inappropriate attention, appalling workmanship and bad debts\u201d. The critical comment from the Funeral Directors\u2019 Association, he added, was based on unsubstantiated rumours.\n Turning to the requirement for accuracy, Mr Freedman contended that the item failed to distinguish between fact and highly critical comment. Further, the item should have reported that efforts had been made to put Mr Angus out of business, and that had included an attack on the company\u2019s hearse.\n Moreover, Mr Freedman wrote, the item was unfair in that it accepted without question the criticisms of Mr Angus and reported them as fact. In addition, some of the footage used in the item had been gathered through deception, while the item had also used some file footage of Mr Angus taken in 2003.\n In its response to the privacy complaint, TVNZ noted that no private facts were revealed. Further, it asserted that there had been no \u201cintentional intrusion in the nature of prying\u201d as the reporter, like any member of the public, had gone to places where he thought he might find Mr Angus. TVNZ also referred to the privacy principle which states that discussing a matter in the public interest is a defence to a privacy complaint. It maintained that the item was in the public interest as Mr Angus\u2019s business went into liquidation within a month of the broadcast owing creditors $130,000.\n As for balance, TVNZ pointed out that a broadcaster was not obliged to broadcast balancing material. Rather, it was required to make reasonable efforts, or give reasonable opportunities to present balancing material. Such efforts and opportunities had been clearly given on this occasion, TVNZ wrote, pointing to the reporter\u2019s attempts to obtain a response from Mr Angus (which had included faxing a list of questions to Mr Angus several days before travelling to Wainuiomata).\n TVNZ commented that an investigation was not abandoned if one party declined to participate. To do so, it added, would not contribute to the free and unfettered flow of information envisaged by s.14 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.\n As for the complainant\u2019s suggestion that Mr Angus should have been approached informally, TVNZ said that such an offer had been made several days before the broadcast of the item. In view of the item\u2019s focus on some specific actions of the undertaker, TVNZ did not accept that reference to the harassment Mr Angus had experienced was required under the balance standard.\n TVNZ did not accept that the item was inaccurate. It had reported accurately the claims made against Mr Angus, and the genuinely held opinions of the disgruntled families and, as noted above, it stated that \u201cevery effort\u201d had been made to get a response from Mr Angus.\n Turning to the complaint that the item was unfair, TVNZ acknowledged that the logos on the vehicle had been covered. That had been done, it said, to avoid those who worked with Mrs Angus from impeding TVNZ\u2019s efforts. Such a practice, it added, was not unusual and the need for it was apparent as there had been heated exchanges on this occasion between the TVNZ crew and the fire station staff.\n Dissatisfied with TVNZ\u2019s response, Mr Freedman referred the complaint to the Broadcasting Standards Authority under s.8(1)(a) of the Broadcasting Act 1989. The referral was accompanied by some other correspondence he had had with TVNZ in which Mr Freedman questioned the professionalism of TVNZ\u2019s approach.\n In regard to privacy, Mr Freedman said he had not contended that the programme had disclosed private facts. The item, he pointed out, had not dealt with the publicity surrounding the decision of Omega Funeral Services to move its business, but with the concern expressed by two families about Omega\u2019s services.\n Mr Freedman stressed that TVNZ\u2019s reporter was informed on several occasions that Mr and Mrs Angus did not wish to participate in the item. Despite this, they were harassed for several hours and the item included footage taken on their property of the reporter knocking on the side door of their house. TVNZ could not claim that it was exercising the rights of any citizen as it was well aware that it was not going to get an interview. They had visited the property against the Anguses\u2019 wishes, he wrote.\n As for balance, Mr Freedman did not suggest that the item should have been abandoned. Rather, he questioned whether \u201creasonable efforts\u201d had been made in view of the other information which was available.\n Mr Freedman considered the item lacked impartiality by referring to Mr Angus as \u201cthe Undertaker from Hell\u201d. He noted that Mrs Angus\u2019 workmates were angry as they knew she did not want to be filmed but had been harassed in her work place.\n The correspondence attached to the referral included a letter from Mr Angus, apparently to Mr Freedman, to which Mr Angus attached an email from Close Up dated 3 June seeking an interview and listing the issues to be discussed. In his letter to Mr Freedman, Mr Angus said he advised Close Up on 3 June that he did not wish to participate in the programme.\n It also included an email to Mr Freedman from Close Up\u2019s reporter, dated 8 July, in which the reporter expressed surprise that Mr Freedman was \u201cstill defending\u201d Mr Angus in view of his actions. It was followed by a letter to Mr Freedman from TVNZ\u2019s Head of News and Current Affairs, who said it was not appropriate for a reporter \u201cto independently engage in argument over the validity of a story\u201d and he had been counselled accordingly.\n TVNZ maintained that the issues surrounding Omega Funeral Services remained issues of \u201cbroad public interest\u201d. The liquidator, it added, had reported that among the unsecured creditors were people who had prepaid more than $36,000 for funerals.\n As for the comments made by the reporter, TVNZ said that the matter had been dealt with internally and was now closed. \u201cThat argument\u201d, it contended, \u201cdid not impinge upon or relate to programme standards\u201d.\n Mr Freedman said that it was \u201cbizarre\u201d for TVNZ to refer to Omega\u2019s liquidation as that had occurred several weeks after the broadcast. He accepted that the email sent to him from the reporter had been dealt with internally but maintained his belief that the reporter\u2019s actions demonstrated the \u201cunprofessional and biased\u201d manner in which the item had been prepared and broadcast.\n Mr Freedman contended that the item breached the Anguses\u2019 privacy as TVNZ\u2019s attempts to track them down amounted to intrusion. The Authority accepts that TVNZ, before it visited Wainuiomata, knew that Mr Angus, on legal advice, did not want to be interviewed. The Authority acknowledges that journalistic practice is always to attempt to obtain comment from the key subject at the time of doing a story, even if the subject has previously declined to participate. If this practice is not observed, a subject may have changed their position and complain that they were not consulted, The Authority does not intend to consider whether a reporter has an implied licence to enter private property if the reporter is aware that the visit would be unwelcome. That is an issue defined by the law of trespass, and is not an issue of broadcasting standards. In view of the nature of the complaint, the Authority\u2019s concern is whether TVNZ\u2019s actions on this occasion amounted \u2013 in the words of privacy principle (iii) \u2013 to intrusion in the nature of prying.\n The Authority accepts that TVNZ attempted to track down the Anguses. TVNZ visited Mr Angus\u2019s business, Mrs Angus\u2019s place of work, and their home. TVNZ suspected that the approaches would be unwelcome and had covered the insignia on the company car. However, beyond covering the insignia, there is no other evidence that TVNZ resorted to covert tactics. TVNZ wanted to confront Mr and/or Mrs Angus and did so in a way which it believed was direct. Taking into account the overt nature of TVNZ\u2019s actions, the Authority concurs with TVNZ that the methods used were justified in the pursuit of a reluctant interviewee, and that they did not amount to prying that would breach Standard 3. It declines to uphold the privacy complaint.\n When an item deals with a controversial issue of public importance, reasonable efforts must be made or reasonable efforts given to present significant points of view. The Authority considers that this item did address such an issue \u2013 the potential problems with an unregulated funeral director industry. This wider issue was highlighted by the experiences of Mr Angus\u2019s dissatisfied customers and a spokesperson for the Funeral Directors Association.\n The Authority notes, however, that the complainant\u2019s concerns were not that the programme lacked balance in respect of the controversial issue raised by the programme. The complaint instead alleged, in essence, that the programme had portrayed the Anguses unfairly, and made insufficient efforts to put their side of the story. The Authority considers that these concerns are more appropriately addressed as issues of fairness, and therefore subsumes the balance complaint under the Standard 6 (fairness) determination.\n In his referral to the Authority, the complainant did not specify any factual inaccuracies in the programme. His complaint in relation to Standard 5 instead focussed on the requirement for impartiality, and alleged that the programme, in portraying Mr Angus as \u201cthe funeral director from hell\u201d, had adopted a partial point of view.\n The Authority again considers that the essence of the complainant\u2019s concerns is that Mr Angus was treated unfairly, in light of the \u201chighly critical\u201d comments about his business practices, and the \u201cunsubstantiated claims\u201d made by former clients. This aspect of the complaint is therefore dealt with under Standard 6 (fairness).\n In his original complaint, Mr Freedman also alleged that the programme\u2019s sources were not reliable. He referred to a campaign that he alleged had been conducted against Mr Angus in Wainuiomata, and stated that reference to this campaign would have raised \u201cserious questions\u201d as to the interviewees\u2019 reliability.\n Mr Freedman did not pursue this matter on referral of his complaint. For the avoidance of doubt, however, the Authority records that the complainant provided no evidence to suggest that the allegations made against Mr Angus in the programme were motivated by his disputes with other sections of the Wainuiomata community. In the absence of any information casting doubt on the credibility of the interviewees\u2019 story, the Authority finds that TVNZ was entitled to use those sources.\nthe item had not advanced the Anguses\u2019 point of view.\n While the story told in the item dealt mainly with Mr Angus\u2019s competence as a funeral director, other material provided to the Authority suggests that a number of people in Wainuiomata were concerned about other aspects of his business \u2013 in particular its relocation to the main retail area. Mr Freedman explained that incidents involving Omega Funeral Services have been reported to the Wainuiomata police. One incident involved an attack on the company\u2019s hearse.\n The Authority accepts that Mr Angus had been involved in other disputes with sections of the Wainuiomata community, and that these disputes were not canvassed in the item. However, it considers that the fairness standard did not require the item to detail this background. The complainant provided no evidence to establish that the concerns outlined in the programme were not genuine, or that they were part of a \u201cconcerted attack\u201d on Mr Angus\u2019s character, motivated by the disputes other Wainuiomata residents had with him. Accordingly, the Authority considers that the omission of the detail surrounding these other disputes did not render the item unfair.\n In relation to the second limb of the fairness complaint, the Authority observes that TVNZ was required to make Mr Angus aware of the interviewees\u2019 criticisms, and to give him the opportunity to respond. It tried to do so. Indeed, it went to such lengths to obtain Mr Angus\u2019 response that the complainant alleged Mr Angus\u2019s privacy was breached.\n This, of course, does not derogate from a broadcaster\u2019s responsibility to broadcast available information which would have advanced the criticised person\u2019s point of view. The complainant referred to several sources of information that he maintained TVNZ should have included in the programme \u2013 information from local community newspaper the Wainuiomata News, local police, and a website, www.wainuiomata.com.\n The complainant does not advise, however, that any of these sources could have provided information that defended Mr Angus against the allegations made about him in the programme. The examples he has provided relate only to information about the other disagreements in the community involving Mr Angus. As noted above, the Authority considers that in the context of a programme that discussed specific concerns about Mr Angus\u2019s practice as an undertaker, it was not necessary to include information about these other disputes.\n For the above reasons, the Authority considers that TVNZ gave Mr Angus a reasonable opportunity to respond to the allegations. The Authority also notes that the complainant has not pointed to any information available to TVNZ that, in the absence of comment from Mr Angus, could have provided his perspective on the allegations made in the programme. Accordingly, the Authority declines to uphold Mr Freedman\u2019s fairness complaint.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T18:21:52Z", "url": "https://bsa.govt.nz/decisions/3183-freedman-and-television-new-zealand-ltd-2005-095", "byte_size": 15851, "char_size": 15677}

{"text": "\"Bake me a pie or go away,\" I've literally had my son say that to me a few times. So, what was I to do except fulfilling his demand? Baking (not only pies), is a cooking method where tools DO actually make the man, which means that it is very hard or nearly impossible to do it successfully without proper bakeware.\nWith years of experience under my belt, I\u2019ve learned about and discovered what truly matters when looking for bakeware to buy, and I am going to teach you later in the article.\nAlso, I have reviewed what I believe to be the best five non-stick bakeware sets out there, so make sure to check them out if you are in search of one.\nThe first and most obvious reason is \u2013 because food doesn\u2019t stick to it! I do not want to sound overly simplistic, but any chef (or mom, as a matter of fact) knows that pans that stick will absolutely mess up the outcome.\nPeople normally solve this problem by oiling up, but I don\u2019t like it since it makes the food greasy. Using non-stick bakeware is a healthier, more convenient, and more practical way of baking.\nThe next thing that you might not have known is that non-stick bakeware is so much easier to clean than more conventional types. It is a no-brainer really \u2013 if nothing sticks to the surface then there won\u2019t be anything to scrub, scrape or wash off.\nThis trait right here will save you tons of time as well as frustration, and it might motivate you to bake more often because of the hassle-free cleaning process. Just make sure to maintain the bakeware.\n\u200bLastly, even heat distribution is another thing that you should look for, and this type of bakeware enables it.\nHere's the deal: heat distribution most likely won't affect the quality of the result, but it will make the bakeware heat up more quickly which will ultimately decrease the cooking time.\nInvesting a little bit of time into research can save you a lot of money and trouble in the long run, and that is why you need to read this section carefully.\nBakeware sets differ regarding materials, abilities, cost, and maintenance, so learning about some general features of these products will help you decide which type will fulfill your demands.\nBakeware can be made from different kinds of materials including iron, glass, copper, steel, etc.\nToday I will mention only the types that are related to products I reviewed in this article.\nIt is important to know that each material yields different cooking properties so study these paragraphs to find out which one is right for you.\nCarbon steel \u2013 this material is light, durable, and reacts to temperature changes very quickly, meaning that it can heat up fast. Even though is lightweight, it is a bit heavier than copper and doesn't retain heat as well as iron. It's a good choice for baking meats, veggies, bread, and cakes.\nCopper \u2013 it is an excellent heat conductor and doesn\u2019t need pre-heating since it gets hot very quickly. Very light, but also quite expensive compared to other bakeware materials. Also, it isn\u2019t the best choice for recipes that require baking under very high heat.\nSilicon \u2013 good for foods where sticking is an issue, such as breads, cookies, and cakes. It is light, affordable and dishes will slide out of it easily. The one downside is that it can be frustrating to wash because it is so elastic, but luckily, most of the silicon bakeware is dishwasher safe.\nSince you\u2019ll be buying an entire set of products, it would be a good idea to find one that is suitable for all kinds of baking jobs. Make sure that all the basic items such as pie pan, muffin pan, loaf pan, cookie sheet, cake pan, or whatever you need, is included in the package.\nThis is a feature that most folks overlook, and it makes a world of difference when it comes to handling the pan. It's easy to move the dish around when it's cold but taking it out of a scorching hot oven is a different story (trust me, I know). You\u2019ll try to be cautious not to burn your fingers so it is easy not to pay attention to the contents of the pan which can lead to spillage and a messy kitchen.\nLook for bakeware that has nice, ergonomic handles or handling areas. Some models have silicon added to these parts for extra protection and ease of use.\nNot all types of bakeware can withstand the same temperatures; as a matter of fact, this trait greatly differs from product to product. Certain pans are oven safe to up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, while others cannot take more than 350.\nThis is a significant difference so pay close attention to this detail when buying a set.\nNow, let\u2019s get into the meaty part of this article \u2013 the reviews.\nAfter trying out many sets, I\u2019ve reached some conclusions and decided to put together a list of my favorite ones.\nKeep in mind that these are my personal choices, but they are also top rated products.\nRachel Ray is a world-renowned chef and TV personality, and her famous Cucina line of products never fails to deliver. Here, we are dealing with an excellent, 10-piece set that I personally think very highly of.\nThe material that this bakeware is made of is carbon steel, and the non-stick, latte-colored coating looks very pretty and does the job well.\nA thing that I didn\u2019t like about the construction of this set is that everything is so bulky. It is not a huge issue, but folks who lack storage space will not be thrilled with these products.\nAs far as items are concerned, the set includes two loaf pans, two cake pans, two cookie sheets, two pie plates, a muffin tin, and a plastic cake pan topper.\nIn my opinion, this is more than enough, but I\u2019m sure some folks are going to be disappointed because there\u2019s no pizza pan included.\nThe handles have silicon grips attached to them, and this is a big bonus when it comes to practicality and handling. Also, the rolled edges allow you to grab the pan more easily and move it around securely.\nThe pan can withstand heat of up to 450 F, and I think that this should be sufficient for most baking jobs. Make sure not to go over this temperature because you could burn the pans.\nCopper has gained a lot of popularity in the cooking world over the last few years, and honestly, I can only say good things about it. Copper Chef is known for a plethora of cookware, and now we are taking a look at their baking set.\nAs I've mentioned before, copper is a fantastic heat conductor, and the heat distribution in this material is as even as it gets.\nPersonally, I find the latter feature very important because I like to have consistency in my cooking.\nThis is a 12-piece set that consists of a 12-cup muffin pan, a cookie sheet, a loaf pan, a square pan, and eight pieces of silicon ramekin cups with lids.\nOk, so I think it is a bit unfair for a company to advertise a set of twelve copper products while only four of them are actually made of this material. While the ramekin cups are lovely, they seem to be a cheap filler in this set.\nAs far as handling is concerned, most of the products in this pack do not have handles, so you have to rely on the rolled edges for gripping. This is a big disadvantage in my opinion, and greatly handicaps the ease of use.\nThese black, sturdy-looking baking dishes remind me of old-school bakeware sets that people used to bake with a few decades ago. However, this is a modern and versatile set that should fulfill most of your demands.\nThe ChefLand set is made of carbon steel; it looks pretty plain but has a non-stick coating that's quite effective. One thing that this material is good at is even heat distribution, so you won\u2019t need to worry about hotspots.\nThe products are dishwasher safe, however, after several months of kind of cleaning, some items started to form rust on the outer edges, which is a big minus. I would recommend washing them by hand.\nWhen it comes to the items, ChefLand\u2019s set includes a roasting pan, a round pizza pan, a large and medium cookie sheet, two round cake pans, a square cake pan, a loaf pan, an oven crisper pan, and a 12-cup muffin pan. As far as I\u2019m concerned this set has everything covered!\nMost of the dishes have handles on them, and even those which don't, have a nice grip area that allows for good handling.\nUnfortunately, there is no silicon padding or protective surface so you will need to use gloves or cloth.\nThis bakeware set comes to us from Sunbeam; it is a bit smaller set in terms of the number of items in it, but a worthy addition to today's list. Oh, I forgot to mention it\u2019s cheap as chips!\nThe material these pans are made of is carbon steel, and its non-stick features are achieved with a xylan coating interior and exterior. The black color gives it a pretty plain, non-exciting look, but I personally do not mind this.\nThe Sunbeam set has only 5-pieces, which is significantly less than other sets we reviewed today. The dishes included are a loaf pan, a cookie sheet, a 6-cup muffin pan, and two round cake pans.\nOne disadvantage of this set is that it cannot handle temperatures higher than 400 F, which is quite limiting because some recipes require more heat.\nAll of the pans have handles or enough room to grab them properly and handle safely.\nNow as I was reading some online commentary, many people complained that pans arrived dented or bent when they ordered them, so this might be an issue.\nI haven\u2019t experienced this myself, so I just want to put it out as a warning.\nThis set differs from others I reviewed today because it is the only one that\u2019s not made of metal.\nBoxiki Kitchen brings us this 3-piece silicone set that bread and cake lovers might find interesting.\nAs I\u2019ve said, these products are made of silicone which has its pros and cons.\nThe good thing is that food will just slide out of it, but it might be irritating when trying to wash it by hand because it\u2019s so bendy. A lot of people raise concerns about chemicals in this material, so you\u2019ll be glad to know that this set is FDA approved and non-toxic.\nThe set comes with three items \u2013 a round cake pan, a square brownie pan, and a banana bread/meatloaf pan.\nAll of the dishes are equipped with metal handles which allows for a nice and solid grip, so you won\u2019t have to worry about the pans slipping out of your hands.\nSilicone is generally oven safe up to 500 degrees F, which is fantastic and much better than some metal products, so you won\u2019t need to worry about burning your bakeware.\nHowever, the metal handles don't seem to take high temperatures very well, and I've heard some reports of them flaking and bubbling at 400 F.\nI hope that the article was helpful and that it got you acquainted with the basics of bakeware.\nNow, the time has come for me to declare my top pick of the day, and the product that got most of my sympathies is Rachel Ray\u2019s 10-piece Cucina Set.\nIts beautiful design is what attracted me to this bakeware set, but the excellent performance made an even stronger impression.\nNon-stick surface does its job flawlessly, and the carbon steel construction is sturdy and strong.\nThis is a very good list, i have tested myself the Rachel Ray\u2019s 10-Piece Cucina Bakeware Set and i\u2019m satisfied with it, it fulfill most of my daily cooking.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T02:37:15Z", "url": "https://kitchenbyte.com/best-bakeware-sets/", "byte_size": 11150, "char_size": 11080}

Last week the Police briefed the press about a grenade found on Banak Street in the City and promised an update on the investigations this week. Today however, police informed the media that they had found yet another grenade on Mayflower Street which intersects Vernon Street in Belize City. The discovery was made after authorities received a call at ten yesterday morning. Senior Superintendent Edward Broaster, Deputy Commander of the Eastern Division in Belize City briefed the press this morning. Here is audio provided by our Colleagues at KREM News.\nThe area it was found was under some bushes near a fence in an overgrown empty lot. The grenade was wrapped in several layers of plastic and police add that their intelligence suggests it was placed in the area about thirty minutes prior to them receiving the call. But there is the suggestion that officers of the police department are the ones planting the grenades.\nThere is also the growing fear, since the discovery of the grenade that there may be intent on detonating one such weapon in a crowded area during the upcoming September festivities.

{"text": "Unlocking student talent is an approach to personalizing learning? In brief, it\u2019s about putting kids first by giving them \u201cvoice and choice\u201d in their own learning. Integrated into the 21st Century classrooms of differentiated learning that vary the \u201cpace and face\u201d of instruction to target the individualized differences. These purposefully-designed student-centered classrooms, encapsulate the accepted concept of personalizing learning. It is when these three components intersect, differentiation, individualization and student-centeredness.This is the next generation of the differentiated classroom and the added refinements are clearly outlined: Personalized learning adapts a metacognitive approach that fosters self-direction, self- monitoring and self-evaluation. In essence, personalized learning is student ownership. However, this new model is guided by motivating factors that ignite, invigorate and instill the learning, as well as fostering, metacognitive, reflective, coaching and feedback. Personalized learning means greater student achievement through self-determined change (interests), challenge (goals) and choice (methods). In short, the thrust is to engage students in ways that they become the \u201cstewards of their own learning\u201d.\nHow do we prepare our students for the test of life? We teach them how to learn when they are not being taught! In other words, we give them the gift of self-reflection, self-awareness, self-initiative, self-direction, self-assessment and self-regulation \u2013 the gift of knowing when they know, and when they don\u2019t know. Metacognition: The Neglected Skill Set for Empowering Students, is written with the teacher in mind. It is more practical than theoretical, but most definitely grounded in research findings and connected to emergent data. With the 30 ready-to-use metacognitive strategies in this book, teachers will deepen learning for their students through explicit reflections on planning, monitoring and evaluating their own work. As students learn how to \u201cthink about their own thinking\u201d, they become more aware and, thus, better able to make adjustments on their own work. They gain a sense of ownership, and teachers get results they can count on through students empowerment. Metacognition is like magic for 21st century classrooms \u2013 it changes student behaviors before your eyes.\nThinking About Thinking in IB Schools: How We Know What We Know.\nThe quintessential question, \u201cHow do we know what we know?\u201d seems to drive the quest for high performing learners to learn more, dig deeper, explore, investigate and in the end, be able to validate and justify. With rigorous principles paralleling the International Baccalaureate curriculum framework, (as well as other recognized curriculum frameworks) drive that inquiry. While \u201cknowledge comes on the coattails of thinking, the Theory of Knowledge approach extends this, as students dig into the evidence-based scenarios about, \u201dHow we know what we know\u201d. This professional learning enhances the work of students with the depth and breath of mega-thinkers. It supports the remarkable curriculum work, with complementary discussions and exercises that provide that added, oomph! Grounded in principles of curiosity, confidence, connectedness, reasoning, communication, reflection and open-mindedness, practical threads of thinking, practicing and performing are ever-present. Empower students with lifelong skills that will impact every sector of their lives.\nReal world application drives 21st Century, academic learning. In this generation, students don\u2019t learn to do they do to learn. They live in a fast-paced society and are impatient with the slow and steady rhythm of the traditional classroom. How do significant curriculum shifts toward a more relevant, rigorous, inquiry-oriented approach occur within this assessment-driven culture? How do teachers guide kids to dig into authentic problems? How do they support \u201chigh-tech\u201d applications in a digital-rich classroom? How do they foster collegial, \u201chigh-touch\u201d teamwork on projects and papers? How do they challenge students with rigor in \u201chigh-thought\u201d explorations, investigations, and experimentations? \u201cThe times, they are a changing\u201d, and they are changing at breakneck speed. How do we, as leaders, retool schools to meet the challenges in relevant ways?\nNuggets of info and some great tools . . .the takeaway strategies that can be applied in the classroom immediately w/o a lot of changes to lessons will be all helpful in adding deeper critical thinking. Joey Dale, Middle School.\nIt's time to transform instruction with enriched Problem-based Learning in a Nutshell Here is the big secret about PBL . . . It\u2019s not that complicated! Moving toward relevance in the curriculum that uses 21st Century, real-world applications, student inquiry models are front and center-problem-based, project, and service learning experiences are among the most frequently cited. It\u2019s efffective to get started with tools already familiar to teachers today: graphic organizers, essential questions, rich and relevant content, rigorous thinking skills, digital-rich tools for searching and researching, collaborative team work and presentation skills. Simply put: PBL is like DIY (Do It Yourself) projects- Do It-to-Learn-It, 21st Century methodology, rather, than Learn It-to-Do-It, 20th Century traditions.\nGreat job of not being an educational \u201cexpert\u201d yet, being an entertaining presenter. Wish more people had you background and experience to share with teachers. Alice McKay, High School English.\nUsing the Three Story Intellect to assure teachers that students are moving through the three levels of thinking-gathering, processing and applying, students learn to think more deeply. As they become more aware of their thinking, confidence increases dramatically, and the shift from the teacher-directed classroom environment to a student-centered culture of respect, responsibility and reliability is the ultimate goal. Learn how to teach kids to think, critically and creatively. Help students begin earlier, rather than later, to adapt self-dispositions of mindfulness that prepare them for test of life. Grounded in 21st Century thinking processes: productive problem solving, mindful decision-making and creative innovation, students develop awareness and control of their own actions, words and deeds.

Excite! Ignite! is about that mysterious, magical, confounding, frustrating, exhilarating, important, and misunderstood profession of the classroom teacher. Three million teachers currently work with 50 million students in US k12 classrooms. NCES.Gov, 2015. Among these dedicated teachers, many find that their most valuable help, often comes from other teachers, the teacher across the hall or down the wing a ways, or through chance meetings in the teacher workroom. This book is for them. It consists of ideas, strategies, quotes and notes from thousands of teacher-to-teacher interactions.\nIt was such a pleasure to see you work with our teachers last week. What a very talented and professional pair you are. I know our district's students will benefit from your shared expertise.

Amoyo means \u201cspirit of appreciation\u201d (appreciating everything and everyone) and our unique approach to upskilling and empowering the children of Hout Bay is already having a huge impact, not only on the children but on their families and the broader community, too.\nAmoyo is so much more than just a performing arts training programme. Our classes are a platform to engage with our youth, to show them we care about them, about the choices they are making, that we are there to support and help them develop into successful, employable adults. The Amoyo journey aligns skill development with self-respect, respect for others, integrity, emotional intelligence and communication skills needed to survive in the fast paced professional world outside of their immediate environment of poverty, neglect, criminal and gang activity.\nIt\u2019s amazing what you\u2019re doing at Amoyo. I look forward to visiting when I\u2019m back in Cape Town soon.\nAt AMOYO, we greatly appreciate any donation big or small, enabling us to continue to help enrich and support the lives of these children.\nAmoyo is an after school and weekend performing arts training platform (dance, acting, singing) working with over 150 impoverished children from the townships in Hout Bay.\nMbuzeli is going to be our new fundraiser and has extensive experience in the NGO sector, specialising in resource development and organizational sustainability.\nHe has gained and applied almost two decades of know-how in various settings in the non-profit space.

{"text": "Go local. Choose local. Buy local. These directives have sprung up on signs all over the shelves of my natural products store. What do these words really mean, and why should I care?\nI got some of the answers when I visited my in-laws in Vermont in September. Their Montpelier community had just wrapped up a monthlong \"Localvore Challenge.\" Sure, I knew about omnivores and herbivores, but what the heck are localvores? They are, I learned, people dedicated to eating food grown and produced locally\u2014in the case of Montpelier, within a 100-mile radius of town. I also learned that this can be a pretty easy task during Vermont's plentiful harvest season. The state has many, many farms growing and making a vast array of foods\u2014from fresh cheddar cheese and maple syrup to blueberries, apples, and tons of veggies. How lucky for those from the Green Mountain State\u2014and isn't Vermont also home to Ben & Jerry's ice cream?\nOn second thought, those pleasure pints surely aren't made entirely with Vermont staples. Maybe the challenge to eat local isn't such a gimme after all.\nBut it is a worthy goal. Consider this: On average, food is grown 1,500 miles from where it's consumed, according to Carolyn Mugar, executive director of Farm Aid, whom we interviewed for this month's Evolve column.\nBy eating local, you help the environment by conserving fuel used to transport food. You strengthen your regional economy. And you enjoy tastier bites because local food is often fresher.\nOf course, eating local isn't always possible; Colorado, where I live, certainly isn't known for its enormous winter harvest. Nor is it necessarily easy\u2014I know I'd have trouble giving up my daily bowl of banana-topped cereal. Still, it's a good idea to think about your choices and their impact on your community, your health, and the environment.\nAs a Thanksgiving gesture that I hope continues beyond the month, I plan to express a little gratitude to my local growers and natural foods manufacturers by picking up a few more of their items at the grocery store. If you take up a similar challenge, I'd love to hear about your experience.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T06:37:31Z", "url": "https://www.deliciousliving.com/old-nh360/business/give-thanks-local-farmers/", "byte_size": 2126, "char_size": 2118}
{"text": "When asked by a fan on Twitter when Ava DuVernay would be wearing the director\u2019s hat again for the hit series \u201cQueen Sugar\u201d the screenwriter revealed that she will not be directing episodes of the OWN series \u201cfor a while\u201d in an attempt to make space for other women who wish to step into the role and take lead.\nIn 2017, the Center for the Study of Women in Television & Film at San Diego State University released a study that revealed that the number of female directors has declined from 2015, with only 7 percent of the 250 top grossing films of 2016 being directed by women. This was a 2 percent decline from the previous year. The Center also found that women only made up 26 percent of television creators in roles like directing, writing, producing, and more; this is particularly bad because the same study also found that shows with at least one female creator had \u201chigher percentages of female characters overall.\u201d Essentially, more women behind the camera meant more women, written with nuance and complexity, in front of it.\nDuvernay\u2019s radical, post-diversity acts assume that perhaps the systems in place to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace have atrophied beyond what\u2019s useful; and that \u2013 all things being equal \u2013 there are always ways to take matters into your own hands \u2013 to groom talent and handpick your replacements to ensure continuity of legacy \u2026 or a seat at the table.\nThe late Dr. Brenda Watts Jones was the first African-American president of Atlanta Technical College and she intentionally spoke life into who would become her successor \u2013 Dr. Alvetta Peterman Thomas. She was deliberate and intentional \u2013 specifically telling Thomas who was vice president of academic affairs prior to 2008 that she \u201cwould be president.\u201d And the grooming ensued.\nBut not without groundwork \u2013 dissertation level preparation.\nThomas\u2019 doctoral dissertation research was a qualitative case study of African-American women executive leaders in two-year colleges. Five African-American women directors of instruction from a two-year college system in the southeastern United States were interviewed to examine factors that contributed to their career succession experiences.\nOf the three conclusions from the study findings, Thomas found that as an appendage to racism and sexism that\u2019s evident throughout every facet of the career succession experience, said career succession experiences were leveraged by institutional and professional factors such as supervisory and institutional support for education and career development, mentoring, and restricted network opportunities. The impending leadership crisis presented an excellent opportunity to recruit and train the untapped human resource, African-American women, for future two-year college leadership.\nDr. Victoria Seals, who stepped into the role as president of Atlanta Technical College when Thomas became president of Southern Crescent Technical College added to the literature on women in leadership and women\u2019s career development. Her dissertation work identified and described the dimensions of support necessary for women to be successful in attaining executive leadership positions in community and technical colleges. Of the components perceived as influential in the career development of women in community and technical college leadership: guidance by senior leadership, by far, top billed.\nThe quality of the successor is just as important as the foresight, preparation and definitions of success of the predecessor.\nFirst the question, \u2018What does it mean to be a successful company or organizational head?\u2019 must be asked. When you consider the profile of a \u201csuccessful company\u201d you typically think of financial performance, annual growth, valuation, acquisitions, public perception and profitability. In order to have a complete picture of what it means to be successful CEO, you cannot leave out your successor. You could have done an excellent job as CEO, but if you leave and the company tanks, your tenure was not successful. The point of successful and intentional succession planning is to create systems and company cultures to outlast you. A very successful transition to a new leader has to be a part of the CEO\u2019s thinking: Good onboarding, great tenure, strong successor.\nStart by seeing who is ready within the organization and begin putting them in positions of impact and responsibility. This doesn\u2019t just apply for internal colleagues. If the person isn\u2019t already an employee, bring them in and get them working. Make them a senior level vice president, or bring them in on the board and get the board comfortable with your heir apparent.\nFace time with the board of directors or an advisory body of consequence goes towards the end goal: To get someone, other than you, to organically come to the conclusion that your \u201cpick\u201d could be your successor without you necessarily spelling it out.\nUnless it is a volatile ouster, the timeframe of the transition is dependent upon the company. A lengthy, but open and transparent process that floats conversations of impending transitions early quells uncertainty and insecurity.\nFor example, long before he died, Citizens Trust Bank\u2019s longtime president James Young was sure to handpick and groom his successor \u2013 Cynthia Day. Day started working with Young to succeed him in 2005 when she became executive vice president of management services. Under Young\u2019s guidance, she worked on all aspects of the bank including new product development and an acquisition strategy. Seven years later, in February 2012, she was named president.\nIn other cases, the power of intentional suggestion is the catalyst for grooming.\nThe push that she needed to continue came from Judge Shawn Ellen LaGrua, current Superior Court Judge in Fulton County and former Solicitor General for DeKalb County.\nAnd though she has not picked her successor yet having only been in the role for eight months to date, she is inspired by the pipeline of young lawyers she is developing around her.\nAnother potential obstacle \u2013 revealing to your respective industry your team MVP or your deep bench creates easy targets for competitive talent pool exposure and poaching.\nBut sometimes, you wind up the winner.\nCase in point: Julie Dash who became the first African-American woman to have a wide theatrical release of her feature film when she broke through racial and gender boundaries 26 years ago with her Sundance award-winning film \u201cDaughters of the Dust\u201d joined Spelman College this fall as a distinguished professor of fine arts; and too, joins Duvernay as one of the growing cohort of directors she has tapped to direct \u201cQueen Sugar\u201d this season as her replacements.\nHow Does the SIMPLE IRA Plan for Small Business Work?", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T23:53:29Z", "url": "http://www.atlantatribune.com/2017/09/19/the-only-way-up-diversity-through-succession-could-be-the-key/", "byte_size": 6817, "char_size": 6741}

So legitimate email from ICIWorld can be trapped in your SPAM FOLDER. Yet each EMail contains information for contacts for potential real estate transactions. The spam folder is is different from junk. Look for a column of folders one called \u201cmore.\u201d You will find a spam folder there. You can put a check mark on the listing and click on Not Spam. If you have not done this before, you will probably find other mail that should not be spam. However marking mail as not spam does not seem to work all the time. Mail seems to continue to go to spam. So GMail has another option. Another way you can try to keep it out of spam you have to set a filter.\nGmail\u2019s filters allow you to manage the flow of incoming messages. Using filters, you can automatically label, archive, delete, star, or forward your mail, even keep it out of Spam.

{"text": "After Brent oil prices sank to new lows of less than USD 30/bbl at the beginning of this year, the GCC energy market witnessed a further slowdown in project activity from already low levels of activity that has been witnessed in the past two years. While the first half of 2016 saw relatively lower project spends (c.USD 20.6bn) than that seen in H1 of 2014 (c.USD 46.5bn) and H1 of 2015 (c.USD 32.8bn), a look at the project awards in each quarter of this year reveals that Q2 2016 (c.USD 7.5bn) witnessed a c.42% fall in project awards compared with Q1 2016 \u2013 which was already considered one of the weakest quarter in terms of project activity.\nAs this quarter witnessed remarkably low project spends, the worst seen in the past 5 years, a comparison of the Q2 project awards for the past several years was also carried out. Data confirms, however, that low spends for this quarter were due to market instability rather than seasonality. The following figure (Figure 1) illustrates the aforementioned trends in project awards seen over the past two years.\nFurther examination of Q2 2016 spends reveals that this was not due to a poor pipeline either, as Q2 2016 initially had c.USD 30bn worth of projects planned for award. A deeper analysis of the data depicts that all projects above c.USD 500mn that were due for award this quarter, faced delays, and were postponed for award to H2 2016, except for two projects \u2013 ALBA\u2019s Aluminium Plant Expansion Phase 6 - Smelter worth c.USD 2.5bn and Aramco\u2019s Arabiyah-Hasbah Development: Hasbah Sour Gas Field Expansion worth c.USD 1.7bn.\nLack of Funding: Large spenders in the region experienced a slowdown in project activity due to issues related to financing, as governments focus on reducing their fiscal deficits. Data by Bloomberg reveals that energy producers in the GCC more than doubled their borrowings this quarter with Saudi Arabia leading the way as the largest borrower. Saudi energy companies have borrowed c.USD 23.1bn in the past 18 months, almost as much as the c.USD 23.4bn they borrowed over the past eight years. These numbers include credits given to companies involved in oil exploration, production, refining and natural gas services & processing.\nMajor Restructuring in the Oil & Gas Space: Countries such as Saudi Arabia and UAE have undergone major re-structuring within the key decision making hierarchy. While Saudi Arabia saw the replacement of its energy minister to Khalid al-Falih, who is planning to focus on diversifying the country\u2019s energy portfolio, UAE saw its national oil company, ADNOC, go through a major reshuffle this quarter in an effort to drive efficiency, performance and profitability of the business. With major re-structuring taking place in the industry, projects are now experiencing further delays as new department heads are re-evaluating the viability and the necessity of several projects.\nCurrent Workload & Lack of Resources: Kuwait, another large spender in the region, witnessed a fall in project awards due to the fact that the country is currently executing several mega-projects already and does not have additional capacity to take on more mega projects.\nWhile a majority of the GCC countries are facing a slowdown in project activity, Bahrain on the other hand, has witnessed its strongest quarter in terms of project spends in the past decade. This was due to the award of ALBA\u2019s Aluminium Plant Expansion Phase 6 - Smelter. Moreover, the country\u2019s future pipeline continues to look strong as it expects to witness further large spends due to its upcoming Sitra Refinery Modernization Program by BAPCO worth c.USD 4.5bn, GPIC\u2019s Ammonia/Urea Plant Expansion worth c.USD 1.5bn and ALBA\u2019s Aluminium Plant Expansion Phase 6 - Power Plant 5 worth c.USD 750mn.\n\"H2 2016, however, is expected to be dominated by the downstream sector (c.USD 18.8bn) with refining and gas processing accounting for the largest share (c.50% and c.19% respectively within the downstream sector). \"\nA sector analysis of the first half of this year depicts that H1 2016 witnessed very low downstream activity (c.USD 5bn) and was largely dominated by the power, oil & gas production and pipeline sector; these sectors saw c.21%, c.20% and c.18% of awards respectively. H2 2016, however, is expected to be dominated by the downstream sector (c.USD 18.8bn) with refining and gas processing accounting for the largest share (c.50% and c.19% respectively within the downstream sector). While the downstream sector is expected to witness major awards in the second half of the year, H2 2016 anticipates the largest number of awards to take place in the water & waste and power sector (c.29% and c.25% of total planned for award).\nIn order to understand the contractor landscape, a deeper analysis of the projects awarded in the first half of this year was carried out. This revealed the dominance of the Asian contractors (such as SEPCO III and HDEC) that won four out of the six projects which were above the c.USD 750mn threshold, when compared to only two projects won by the Western contractors (i.e. Bechtel and SNC Lavalin). An assessment of the future projects and the contractors bidding for these projects illustrates that a similar trend will be seen in the latter half of the year with Asian contractors, in particular, Koreans, dominating the contractor landscape. Korean contractors such as Samsung E&C, GS Engineering and Hyundai (HDEC & HEC) are bidding on many projects, and thus, have a higher likelihood of winning more projects than their Western competitors such as Tecnicas Reunidas, Petrofac, Saipem and CB&I.\nLooking at the future projects for the remainder of the year, we see that the GCC market has c.USD 66.2bn worth of projects planned \u2013 with Q3 2016 expecting to see the award of c.57% of planned projects. A country-wise analysis for this year reveals that Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE will account for c.26%, c.25% and c.19% of total planned projects. However, using Contax Partners\u2019 Tiering methodology (where Tier 1 projects have a 70% or greater probability of going ahead and Tier 2 projects have a 30% probability of being awarded), Contax Partners forecasts that only USD c.USD 28.6bn worth of additional projects have a realistic chance of being awarded this year. Thus, total capex spends of c.USD 49.3bn is anticipated for 2016. Several key upcoming mega-projects for this year include: DRPIC\u2019s Duqm Refinery, Saudi Aramco\u2019s Ras Tanura Refinery Clean Fuels and Aromatics Project, ENOC\u2019s Jebel Ali Refinery Expansion and KOC\u2019s Jurassic Non Associated: Phase 2: East & West Raudhatain Field Development.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T12:51:41Z", "url": "http://contaxpartners.com/capex-report/energy-h1-capex-2016", "byte_size": 6648, "char_size": 6618}

{"text": "Why Do Cluster Headaches Occur On Just One Side of the Head?\nCluster headaches are a very unique type of headache for many reasons. For example, they are most common among men, they can be triggered by seasonal changes, and they are marked by several hours of severe pain on one side of the head.\nIn contrast, many other types of headaches create more generalized pain that exists on various parts of the head. Cluster headaches are also considered to be among the most painful headaches that exist.\nThis is a discussion of why cluster headaches are experienced on a certain side of the head, whether they can change sides, and if the pain can radiate to other parts of the body.\nMedical professionals believe that the hypothalamus, which is small part in the center of the brain, plays a role in causing cluster headaches. This is the part of the brain that controls automatic functions, such as body temperature, digestion regulation, and many other important functions.\nAlthough the exact cause of cluster headaches is still unknown, one widely accepted theory is that the hypothalamus can malfunction and cause the carotid arteries to enlarge and press on certain nerves. There is a bundle of trigeminal nerves on each side of the head, and it is possible that just one of those bundles is affected at a time.\nThe pain that is created on one side of the head is typically centered behind the eye or outwards a bit further towards the ear. On that same side, an individual who is suffering from a cluster headache will also likely experience a red eye, increased tear flow, a reduced pupil size, and a drooping eyelid in that one eye.\nSomething interesting about cluster headaches is that they do have the ability to switch from one side of the head to the other. Some individuals experience cluster headaches on the same side of the head every time they occur. However, it is possible for this type of headache to switch to the other side in subsequent episodes.\nAlso, it is possible for a person to experience chronic cluster headaches for a while and then switch to episodic cluster headaches at a later time. A designation of \u201cepisodic\u201d means that the headaches occur cycles lasting one week to one year and are separated by pain-free periods of at least a month.\nAlthough one side of the head is predominantly affected during a cluster headache, it is also possible for the pain to radiate into other parts of the body as well. The most common body parts that a cluster headache will spread to are the nose, teeth, neck, and shoulders on the same side as the head pain. This type of bodily pain is typically described as a burning or piercing sensation.\nThe symptoms of cluster headaches are unique and can typically be diagnosed easily by an experienced physician. Over-the-counter headache medications like Vanquish may be recommended to ease acute symptoms when they strike. Other treatment options to discuss with a doctor for severe symptoms include triptan medications, capsaicin topical creams, and preventative measures to control blood pressure and nerve inflammation.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T08:24:28Z", "url": "https://www.vanquishheadacherelief.com/one-sided-headaches/", "byte_size": 3089, "char_size": 3085}

{"text": "Wildlife rehabilitators said 88 more pigeons were found at an I-65 rest stop where police found 57 others dumped in December.\nWOLCOTT, Ind. (WLFI) \u2014 Wildlife rehibilators said 88 more pigeons were found at an I-65 rest stop where 57 others were dumped in December.\n\"It's a crazy situation,\" said Kim Hoover with Hoots to Howls Wildlife Rehabilitation.\nHoover was notified of the dumping on Feb. 28. An attendant at the White County rest stop on northbound I-65 called her. Hoover said nine boxes, identical to those found in December, were filled with pigeons in a dumpster. Four of the 88 pigeons were found dead, Hoover said.\nThe discovery now makes 145 pigeons found dumped in the same dumpster. Indiana State Police recovered 57 pigeons on Dec. 10. Hoover never thought she would see another situation like this again.\n\"I thought it was a rare act, never happen again, once in a lifetime as heart wrenching as it was then it happens two months later and you're like really?\" she said.\nUnlike the December discovery where the birds were buried in the dumpster, this flock was found on top of trash. Hoover said likely, they were dumped overnight between Feb. 27 and Feb. 28.\n\"They're gorgeous birds,\" said Hoover. \"These are some of the prettiest pigeons I've ever seen. It just stinks.\"\nShe said pigeon enthusiasts reached out to her and helped fill in some of the blanks. The pigeons found in the dumpster are Parlor Roller pigeons. They are bred for their ability to somersault on the ground. People roll them on the ground in competitions to see how far they can go. Click here and go to the 3:03 minute mark to see these rolling birds in action.\nThere are pigeon clubs who compete with these birds humanely, but Hoover believes these dumpster pigeons were part of an illegal gambling ring and were abused. She said both times she came to resuce the birds, they had parasites on them and the boxes they were in did not have breathing holes.\n\"There's a lot of money being made and I am told that this fellow could care less about fines because he knows they won't get in trouble,\" she said.\nHoover said the birds found recently had the same tags on them as the ones found in December. The tags had the name and phone number of a Dublin, Ohio man. News 18 attempted to make calls to the number provided and it has been disconnected. The fact that the man is located out of state is causing problems for who is responsible to help.\n\"The animal control of Dublin Ohio which is where they come from say they were dumped in Indiana and Indiana is like well they came from Ohio,\" said Hoover.\nHoover said she is worried that this has happened at this rest stop other times but unfortunately, those birds were not found in time. She suggested the rest stop get security cameras, but found out that the state won't fund it.\nWildlife centers in Valparaiso and Illinois took a majority of the birds from Hoover. She has 11 left in her care. She said she has received offers of help from other people as well, which she is thankful for. So what's next for the birds?\n\"They have got to get their health up and hopefully then adopted out,\" she said. \"They are trying to find people who understand the birds and you don't want them to go back into the same situation they came from.\"", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T02:57:18Z", "url": "https://www.wlfi.com/content/news/88-more-pigeons-found-dumped-in-same-I-65-rest-stop--507398411.html", "byte_size": 3277, "char_size": 3275}

{"text": "So basically with the money I've spent on Clairol Hydrience I could have gone just to a salon in the first place and had somebody with a brain smack me upside the head, tell me what a dumb idea it would be to darken my hair, and spruce up the fabulous color I already had.\nIf this doen't work tomorrow I'm going to cry like a baby. Yes, I am such a GIRL. And no, I will not post any pictures!\nOh Tracey! If I was closer, I'd volunteer to watch your girls so you could go to the salon because I KNOW how much a woman's hair means!!\nIt will all be okay--it may just take some time to get it back to normal. But no more fussing with those pretty blond locks once it's fixed!\nTracey, I think it best that you get thee to a salon. It's not possible to \"dye\" your hair a lighter color once you've applied a darker color. If you originally had darker hair, you'd have to bleach it first in order to go blonde. You have to take out the darker color - aka bleach it. Hydrience is a permanent color - meaning it can't be washed out. Since you're not in the habit of coloring your hair, I'm sure that getting this fixed will not do too much damage. Have the processing done first and then get the ends cut off if they look too dry.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T12:06:40Z", "url": "http://www.traceysspace.net/2005/11/wherein-i-find-completely-superficial.html", "byte_size": 1220, "char_size": 1220}

{"text": "Until recent years, Calvert County was a rural area with dusty narrow roads, acres of planted fields, and far from everything. Although Southern Maryland was the first part of the original thirteen colonies to be settled by Roman Catholics (as early as 1634), Catholicism in Calvert County had a long and difficult path to follow. By 1706 there were 3,611 people living in our county but only 48 were Catholics.\nFather Maurice B. Alexander, pastor of Our Lady Star of the Sea in Solomons, started our parish as a mission in the late 1920\u2019s. In 1937 our Church was built. Following Father Alexander\u2019s death in 1946, a succession of short term pastors served both Our Lady Star of the Sea and the Prince Frederick mission. In 1965, we became an independent parish with 100 families and Father Naughton as our first pastor.\nSt. John Vianney Parish has progressed from a mission church to a rapidly growing community requiring larger facilities. In 1990, we celebrated our twenty-fifth anniversary. Several years before then we became a tithing parish and through tithing we have witnessed many blessings and a strengthening of our growing faith. God has blessed us with much growth and change.\nThe son of a small farmer, Jean-Marie Vianney was born near Lyons, France on May 8, 1786. At age 20, he started his studies for the priesthood. During Lent in 1807, Jean-Marie received the sacrament of Confirmation. He chose the Confirmation name \"John Baptist\" after his favorite saint. Jean-Marie was ordained August 12, 1815.\nIn 1818, Jean-Marie was made the parish priest of Ars, a small sleepy village France. Today, Ars is known over the world for this priest, a \"model of goodness.\"\nFor more than thirty years, Ars was a place of pilgrimage for people from all over France. They came and waited two or three days to go to confession to the Cur\u00e9 . They went back home with new courage and hope.\nJean Marie Baptiste Vianney was the parish priest of Ars for forty-one years. He died on August 4, 1859. Eighty six years later he was canonized by Pius XI, and in 1929 he was declared the principal patron saint of parish priests throughout the world.\n1903 Rev. John McNamara was named pastor of St. Francis de Sales, Benedict. He served the areas of Benedict, Solomons, and Prince Frederick.\n1920 Rev. Maurice B. Alexander became the first pastor of Our Lady Star of the Sea, Solomons. He also celebrated Mass in Prince Frederick until 1938.\n1937 The cornerstone was laid for the new church in Prince Frederick under the patronage of St. John Vianney, Patron of Parish Priests.\n1938 Mass was celebrated for the first time in the new church.\n1965 Archbishop Patrick O\u2019Boyle designated St. John Vianney as a parish and appointed Father Joseph Naughton as the first pastor.\n1966 Present rectory was purchased.\n1979 Parish Center (Vianney Room) was built.\n1990 Parishioners observe the 25th Anniversary of the canonical establishment of St. John Vianney Parish.\n1993 New wing on Parish Center was built which contains the parish office, classrooms and a library. The entry foyer was capped with a square cupola to reflect the waterfront areas of our community. It is symbolic of the church\u2019s role in being a guiding light to those who live in the community.\n1995 The adult religious education program, Pathways, began.\n1996 Christian Beginnings, the parish pre-school, along with a playground was established. A new porch and arbor were added to the Church along with additions to the Church\u2019s Community Room including a handicapped bathroom and a kitchenette.\n1997 A Catholic cemetery was established on the Church grounds. The parish assisted with the establishment of a crisis pregnancy center, Birthright, and a homeless shelter, ECHO.\n2002 Dedication of new church.\n2006 Safe Nights program started.\n2007 Completed church basement build out.\n2008 Started Nicaragua housing program.\n2010 Parish became debt free.\n2011 Vianney Room renovation and expansion completed.\n2014 Expanded cemetery to area along Main Street with a second columbarium.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T17:52:51Z", "url": "https://www.sjvchurch.net/parish-history", "byte_size": 4046, "char_size": 4035}

{"text": "\"Why am I fat?\" A question I receive daily. You would think the question would be, \"How can I be permanently thin?\" But that's not the case. The majority of the time it's about \"am I too fat\" as opposed to seeking a real and practical solution to the overweight problem.\nThere is no mystery why people are fat. The average American consumes 20% more calories than 20 years ago. The average American will consume approximately 100 calories more per day than they will burn. An energy gap equaling a yearly weight gain of 10.4 pounds.\nReasons and causes of obesity are numerous. Learned behavior, biological, environmental are only a few factors that influence obesity. In my experience, three factors are constant with overweight people -- sedentary lifestyle, chronic dieting and poor eating habits.\nDon't ask, \"Why am I fat?\"\nAsk, \"How can I lose weight and keep it off?\"\nSymptoms of obesity are easily identifiable. For instance, if you don't eat breakfast, you are four times more likely to be overweight than those who do. If you eat at fast food restaurants at least once per day, double your likelihood of an overweight problem. A Harvard University study revealed young people ate 110 to 165 more calories than they burned daily, for ten years, resulting in an average 58 pound weight gain! Approximately 25% of the vegetables consumed by the average American consists of potato chips and french fries.\n\"How can I reach my ideal body weight and maintain it for life?\" My answer is simple. Reduce portions and increase your level of physical activity. Once you reach your ideal weight, when weight loss is no longer an issue, begin to improve the nutritional value of your diet. Repeat daily until you establish automatic subconscious habits. See Sequence of Weight Loss Success for more.\nI always get the feeling when someone asks \"Why am I fat?\", it's because the person is embarrassed. By pretending to not know the causes of obesity, they can not be expected to correct the problem. A simple absolution of responsibility.\nThere is nothing wrong with you! You don't need to feel embarrassed or ashamed of your weight. This is the biggest obstacle to success you must overcome... You! How you feel about yourself.\nYou have not broken any laws. You are not a criminal. If you are a social outcast or living in isolation it's because you choose to do so. Once you understand weight loss is completely in your control, that weight loss is certain because it's guaranteed by your choices, actions, behaviors and attitude -- once you have this epiphany, weight loss is no longer hard, difficult or a mystery.\nThere is no difference between overweight people and naturally thin people. Both want the best for their kids. Both want good jobs and a happy and safe home. The only difference is how the overweight view themselves. This poor self-image is at the very root of the helpless feeling and confusion the overweight have about losing weight.\nCombine poor self-image caused by a society obsessed with \"size 4 syndrome\" with a history of chronic dieting that causes progressive weight gain and a sedentary lifestyle and you have a prescription for life long cascading weight gain and obesity.\nAll of this is so avoidable it breaks my heart. First, you must repair your damaged self-image. Like yourself. Respect yourself. So you've gained weight. You're fat. Big deal. Join the 66% of the entire American population that suffers the same condition. Obesity is the norm in America! So don't allow society to label you an \"out of control outcast.\" Don't buy into the weight loss is a great achievement misconception. Weight loss will be as easy as you make it. As sure as your commitment to it. And I'm telling you the 100% truth when I say you have every resource within you necessary to lose weight and live life free of all weight issues.\nWhy am I fat? Am I too fat? Self-depreciating questions that do not warrant time for consideration. There is no fat quiz or symptoms of obesity that can cause or validate your condition. Losing weight is entirely your responsibility. And that's exactly why your success is certain.\nThe only thing preventing you from living a naturally thin life is you. Overcome that obstacle and you're weight loss success is assured.\nI recommend reviewing 110 Quick Weight Loss Tips and Portion Perversion sections of this web site. If what you read makes sense then read my book, Barb's Foolproof Weight Loss Solution. There's nothing wrong with you! You're special -- act like it!\n20 FACTS ON OBESITY Tip #17--\"Why am I fat?\"\nPeople are fat for a myriad of reasons. However, the question is only relevant if it's asked to discover a problem that you intend to correct. Many ask, \"Why am I fat?\" But what they really want to know is, \"What's wrong with me.\" And the answer is liberating.

{"text": "This past summer a pregnant woman was punched in the face while walking along a street in Brooklyn. She was knocked out, but, fortunately, no lasting harm came to her or to her baby. The assailant, a 33-year old man, was quickly apprehended in what seems to be a completely random act of violence.\nNo question that the attack was terrible, but is the neighbor\u2019s conclusion accurate? Should we \u2013 all of us \u2013 fear everyone? I guess, on the one hand, that we might be safer if we do: if we assume that every person, in every situation is trying to hurt us for no reason at all, we will always act to protect ourselves. We will never approach a stranger to say hello or ask if they need help; we will never even smile at them as they walk by. We will always lock our doors, our windows, our cars, and we will always ask ourselves if we are leaving ourselves open to attack \u2013 on the street, at work or school, on the bus or train, at the mall, in the park\u2026 but is that how we want to live?\nYears ago, before 9/11, I gave a sermon in which I asked how many people at that Yom Kippur service knew anyone personally who had been murdered. Out of 900 people in the room, four raised their hands. Now I ask you the same question: with the exception of the vile, calculated attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, how many friends, relatives or acquaintances of yours have been murdered, or even suffered serious injury, at the hand of a stranger?\nI spent a lot of time thinking about this before realizing that the answer, for me, is exactly zero. A relative died in World War II, and a college roommate was killed by a rival for his girlfriend\u2019s affections, but not a single friend, relative or acquaintance of mine has been murdered or seriously hurt by a stranger. When I consider how many thousands of people I have known over the course of my life, that\u2019s seems pretty amazing.\nBut is it so amazing? If we listen to the news it sounds like people are being punched in the face every day, on every street corner. However, if we remember that over 8 million people live in New York City, and another 8 \u00bd million live in New Jersey, then our chances of being punched by a random stranger on one day in August seem to be around 16,500,000 to one. And since it hasn\u2019t happened again since that day, the chances are hundreds of millions to one. But you wouldn\u2019t know that from the news.\nThe job of any news organization is not, actually, to give us the news; it is to make us watch or listen or click or read, so they can sell whatever it is they sell to stay in business. Our job is to ask ourselves whether the reports of random violence are relevant to us and whether we should adjust our lives in response. If someone told me that a knife-wielding lunatic was seen in my development, you can be sure I would bolt the doors. But hearing that a man in Brooklyn punched a pregnant woman, despicable as it was, does not lead me to the conclusion that I \u201chave to be afraid of everyone.\u201d It doesn\u2019t even mean that every person in Brooklyn has to be afraid of everyone.\nFrom the TSA farce at airports to security cameras monitoring cars at Freehold Raceway Mall, we are told to be afraid all day, every day. News reports make it sound like we are lucky to get through a single day without harm. But our life experiences do not bear this out.\nYes, bad things happen in life. But far, far fewer than we imagine. The news has its place and purpose, but we should not let it define our lives for us.\n\u201cFear everyone\u201d is a terrible motto to live by. We deserve better.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T08:34:20Z", "url": "https://trt.org/rabbi-blog-2/should-we-fear-everyone/", "byte_size": 3589, "char_size": 3560}

{"text": "I. Causes of Heart Failure: What every physician needs to know.\nHeart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome in which the heart is unable to provide sufficient blood flow to meet the metabolic needs of the body, or is only able to do so with significantly increased intracardiac filling pressure. However, this is a somewhat older definition, and many people now define heart failure as a clinical syndrome where there is structural heart disease and impaired function.\nHeart failure is often referred to as congestive heart failure (CHF). Many experts believe that the term \u201ccongestion\u201d does not uniformly apply to all patients, and the syndrome is often referred to as \u201cheart failure\u201d in more contemporary times.\nHeart failure is most often characterized as systolic, if ejection fraction (EF) is decreased, and diastolic, if ejection fraction is preserved. \u201cDiastolic\u201d heart failure is also often called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) or heart failure with preserved systolic function (HFPSF).\nSystolic heart failure is often due to damage to the heart, such as ischemia or alcohol exposure. Diastolic heart failure is often due to longstanding hypertension or intracardiac infiltration such as with amyloid protein, which \u201cstiffens\u201d both ventricles. It is not usually possible to distinguish systolic from diastolic heart failure based on signs and symptoms alone, as both share substantial clinical features.\nII. Diagnostic Confirmation: Are you sure your patient has Heart Failure?\nHeart failure is diagnosed at the bedside using history and physical findings. There is no absolute laboratory test for the diagnosis of heart failure.\nA characteristic history includes exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and edema. Physical exam would be notable for volume overload (jugular venous distention, dependent edema), S3 gallop, and often pulmonary rales.\nHowever, it is important to note that the absence of rales does not exclude heart failure, as the lymphatic system can provide substantial compensation, particularly in patients with chronic heart failure. Pulmonary congestion is typically evident on chest radiography.\nPlasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) levels are typically elevated, although renal failure and obesity are commonly recognized confounders. The hallmark laboratory exam of heart failure is an echocardiogram.\nThe presence of a decreased EF is sufficient to give a diagnosis of systolic heart failure; other modalities such as gated nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or gated computed tomography (CT) are also able to determine EF.\nDiastolic heart failure is diagnosed in the presence of the clinical syndrome of heart failure with preserved EF. Efforts should be made to determine the etiology of heart failure.\nExertional dyspnea and fatigue are virtually universal. Volume overload is usually found, but in the modern era of powerful loop diuretics, some patients do not manifest fluid overload.\nNocturnal symptoms such as orthopnea and/or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) are also highly suggestive of heart failure. Abdominal discomfort or fullness is also a frequently reported symptom. Patients with well-compensated heart failure may have minimal symptoms and no evidence of volume overload. Characteristics of end-stage heart failure may include cachexia and Cheyne-Stokes respirations.\nApproximately half of patients with heart failure have systolic failure and the other half have diastolic heart failure. Some have features of both types. Heart failure is perhaps more common in men and in those who identify as black racially.\nRisk increases with age. Regardless, the most important risk factors for developing heart failure on a population basis are hypertension, myocardial infarction, and diabetes.\nThe majority of diastolic heart failure is a result of longstanding hypertension, and this phenotype of heart failure is more common in women. Infiltrative diseases, such as amyloidosis and hemochromatosis, also typically lead to diastolic heart failure, often with restrictive physiology.\nPrior chest radiation is another potential cause of diastolic heart failure, and the incidence may increase as prolonged cancer survivorship increases. Once patients are hospitalized with diastolic heart failure, the prognosis is approximately the same as systolic heart failure.\nHypertension and diabetes also increase the risk of systolic heart failure through the increased risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarctions. Thus efforts to minimize coronary artery disease would be anticipated to have substantial impact on risk of developing heart failure.\nThe causes of systolic heart failure are myriad, including coronary artery disease, genetic or familial, viral (including HIV), idiopathic, valvular, inflammatory (myocarditis, sarcoidosis), thyroid disease, tachycardia-mediated (often from previously unrecognized atrial fibrillation), stress-induced (also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy), nutritional deficiency (such as thiamine or selenium), systemic myopathies (such as muscular dystrophies), and peripartum cardiomyopathy.\nAlcohol, cocaine, methamphetamines, anthracyclines, some antirheumatic medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are common toxic causes of heart failure, which are typically identified through patient history.\nCommon alternative causes of volume overload include renal failure, liver failure, and hypoalbuminemia. Common alternative causes of exertional breathlessness are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (PE), and pneumonia. Coronary artery disease also may present with a dyspnea-predominant phenotype, rather than chest pain, as is classically expected.\nEvaluation of the central venous pressure is of the utmost importance.\nProfoundly low cardiac output states may be characterized by hypotension and/or narrow pulse pressure along with cool or mottled skin.\nSinus tachycardia is common but may be compensatory.\nChest x-ray (CXR) and EKG are essential in the evaluation of a patient with suspected heart failure. Beyond providing information supporting the diagnosis of heart failure, these diagnostic tests often provide an alternative diagnosis (atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, lung mass, etc.) that implies heart failure may not be the key diagnosis.\nEchocardiogram is also essential and will provide substantial information about the size, structure, and function of the heart. MRI, which provides detailed information on the myocardium, should be considered.\nMRI can provide strong, noninvasive evidence of etiology in many cases, such as prior infarction, myocarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, stress or \u201cTakotsubo\u201d cardiomyopathy, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, or hemochromatosis, for example. Positron emission tomography (PET) can also be used to diagnose cardiac sarcoidosis.\nEndomyocardial biopsy should be considered in highly select circumstances, such as suspicion of myocarditis. Biopsy also has a role in defining the subtype of amyloid cardiomyopathy (e.g., transthyretin versus amyloid light-chain (AL)). Patients with a family history of cardiomyopathy should be offered the option of referral for genetic counseling and testing.\nBNP (or NT-proBNP) should be considered, particularly if other causes of dyspnea such as COPD are being considered if there is doubt about the diagnosis. Very low levels virtually exclude heart failure, but can be confounded by obesity.\nElevated levels can be seen in renal failure without substantial heart failure, but at least suggest volume overload. Elevated BNP in the absence of renal failure is strongly suggestive of heart failure, but BNP levels are increased with age.\nBasic metabolic parameters including renal and hepatic function should be measured. Renal dysfunction may be a seen as a result of low cardiac output or elevated venous filling pressure.\nHepatic parameters (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) and international normalized ratio (INR) may be elevated as a consequence of hepatic congestion. Serum albumin is helpful in excluding malnutrition as an alternative explanation for peripheral edema.\nMinor elevations in troponin are characteristic of heart failure exacerbation, but typically do not rise and fall as in acute coronary syndrome; myocarditis should be considered if troponin is substantially elevated. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) would also be typically elevated in myocarditis, but are not diagnostic if elevated. Anemia (hemoglobin or hematocrit) and gout (uric acid) and are also frequent comorbidities to consider.\nAdditional testing to establish the etiology of heart failure should be considered and may include: HIV, ferritin (hemochromatosis), thyroid-stimulating hormone, and serum free light chains (amyloid), for example. Testing for specific viruses other than HIV is not routinely performed, but Coxsackie, Epstein-Barr, and varicella zoster could be considered. Exclusion of connective tissue disease with antinuclear antibodies (ANA) is also often performed.\nCXR film (Figure 1) may show cardiomegaly, but the absence does not exclude heart failure. Pulmonary edema is an important finding, but can be confused with pneumonitis or other causes of diffuse infiltrates. Accompanying findings such as pleural effusions may be helpful in interpretation.\nChest x-ray film demonstrating cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.\nAn echocardiogram will provide size; structural detail, including evaluation of valves; and myocardial function, including EF and presence of absence of regional wall motion abnormalities. This is the most important test when considering heart failure as a diagnosis.\nAbdominal ultrasound may demonstrate hepatomegaly and/or ascites, although these findings are often evident on exam and thus are not routinely indicated.\nThe hallmarks of treatment of diastolic heart failure are control of congestion, heart rate in the presence of atrial fibrillation to increase ventricular filling time, and control of systolic blood pressure. The majority of evidence on the treatment of heart failure has been for systolic heart failure, and is thus the focus of the remainder of this section.\nThere are three \u201cto do\u2019s\u201d in the management of heart failure: (1) control congestion, (2) provide neurohormonal antagonists, and (3) consider sudden cardiac death prevention and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Since congestion causes most symptoms, this should be prioritized.\nCongestion control is achieved with sodium and sometimes (if there is hyponatremia) moderate fluid restriction; most patients need loop diuretics. Congestion is managed the same for systolic and diastolic heart failure.\nSecond, neurohormonal antagonists (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and vasodilators in select populations) are critical for the treatment of systolic heart failure and should be initiated. Although it is critical to use the drugs and doses that were found to be effective in landmark clinical trials, very few patients will tolerate initiation of full doses of these medications, and a period of uptitration over several weeks to months should be anticipated.\nThere is no consensus regarding whether beta-blockers or ACEI/ARB should be initiated first, and beta-blockers should be avoided in the setting of cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia, complete heart block, or bronchospasm. Studies of neurohormonal antagonists for diastolic heart failure have been disappointing, but neurohormonal antagonists are still often used for their antihypertensive effect, and their safety in this population is well-established.\nAlthough there is no mortality benefit, digoxin has been noted to improve symptoms and reduce the risk of hospitalization. Finally, consideration should be given to \u201celectrical therapy,\u201d which consists of CRT (if QRS >130 ms) and sudden cardiac death prevention with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).\nThe risk of sudden cardiac death is much higher with an EF <35%, and in the absence of contraindications such as life expectancy less than 1 year, electrical therapy should be considered. Patients should be receiving optimal medical therapy for at least 3 months before implanting an ICD.\nWearable external defibrillators are sometimes used during the period of medical uptitration to permit reevaluation of EF; a sizable fraction of patients will improve on medical therapy to the point that an implantable ICD is not indicated.\nPatients who are unable to tolerate medical therapy or experience progression despite these therapies suggest a very poor prognosis and may be considered for advanced options, such as mechanical circulatory support (MCS, also known as ventricular assist device or VAD) or heart transplant.\nACEI/ARB and beta-blockers are both initiated at minimal dose, but uptitration of ACEI/ARB is typically prioritized, as full dose can typically be achieved more quickly. Beta-blocker dose is then increased every 1 to 2 weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Timing of the introduction of aldosterone antagonist is individualized based on need for diuretics and potassium supplementation, and often deferred to prioritize ACEI/ARB and beta-blockers.\nAdministration of diuretics is the hallmark of emergency treatment of heart failure and most patients respond promptly. Inadequate response should precipitate rapid escalation of a diuretic dose.\nA common rule of thumb is to double an ineffective dose. Consideration should be given to vasodilators if systemic blood pressure is adequate (e.g., mean arterial pressure greater than 70 to 75 mm Hg). In the event of hypotension or cardiogenic shock, initiation of inotropes, such as dobutamine and/or dopamine, may be necessary. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is an option and mechanical support such as an intraaortic balloon pump may also be indicated.\nIn addition to evaluation of symptomatic response, physical exam findings that should be monitored while providing treatment for heart failure include frequent evaluation of jugular venous pressure and vital signs, with particular attention to blood pressure and heart rate. Sinus tachycardia is often a compensatory response and improvement is thought to represent a favorable response to treatment.\nSerial examinations should also focus attention on the presence of absence of S3/S4, liver span, presence or absence of ascites, and degree and distribution of edema. Urine output should also be monitored, as this provides the most direct measure of pace of decongestion and also indicates adequate (or not) renal perfusion.\nBasic metabolic panels are typically performed shortly after initiation of therapy (at least daily while hospitalized), to monitor renal function and ensure that diuretics are not causing dangerous perturbations in serum potassium levels. Following initiation of aldosterone antagonists, more frequent monitoring of potassium is indicated.\nA commonly used strategy is 1 week after initiation or dose increase, and then again at 1 month. Once a stable medication regimen has been established, routine intermittent testing in heart failure patients is not typically performed. There is some data to suggest that BNP levels may be used to guide therapy.\nMaintaining patients with heart failure on maximally tolerated doses of neurohormonal antagonists (ACEI/ARB, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists) are critical to minimizing risk of disease progression, symptomatic decompensation, hospitalization, and mortality. Application of CRT when indicated has also been shown to improve outcomes, and should be periodically reconsidered, as patient status or criteria for implant may change over time.\nEducation on salt avoidance, the role of fluid restriction, and self-care including daily weight monitoring are all important to reduce burden of disease and avoid hospitalization. Over time, it is not uncommon for patients with heart failure to become intolerant to maximal doses of medical therapy.\nThe need to decrease the doses of medications is a predictor of adverse outcome, and may be an appropriate time to consider evaluation for advanced options. For patients with end-stage disease, palliative care and/or hospice may be appropriate, and deactivation of ICD may be considered.\nDigoxin is sometimes used in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with insufficient rate control. Typical dose is 62.5 to 250 mcg daily.\nConcurrent anemia: Treatment may improve heart failure symptoms.\nConcurrent arrhythmias: Consider the role that uncontrolled arrhythmias may have on heart failure exacerbation. Improved control of atrial fibrillation or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) may improve symptoms. Many antiarrhythmics are contraindicated in severe heart failure.\nConcurrent chronic kidney disease: Continue ACEI/ARB if possible, but if necessary to discontinue, replace with isosorbide/hydralazine combination. May contribute to anemia. Aldosterone antagonists have a substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia.\nConcurrent diabetes: Avoid thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in all heart failure patients and metformin if there is significant renal dysfunction.\nConcurrent gout: It is likely that diuretic dosing will need to be increased if a gout flareup is treated with steroids.\nConcurrent liver disease: Liver congestion is common and may result in the need to alter dose of medications metabolized by the liver.\nConcurrent prostatic hypertrophy: Alpha blockers should be avoided, as they have been shown to increase mortality in heart failure patients.\nConcurrent sleep apnea: Should be treated aggressively to minimize neurohormonal activation.\nAldosterone antagonists should not be used in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease.\nConsider use of the Seattle Heart Failure Model or the Heart Failure Survival Score for estimating a patient\u2019s prognosis.\nConsider referral to dietitian to augment teaching on importance of low-salt diet.\nWeigh yourself at the same time every day and record the result. Report increases of more than 3 lb in a day or 5 lb in a week to your doctor; however, not all decompensations are preceded by antecedent weight gain.\nAvoid sodium intake and strive to keep less than 2,000 mg daily.\nTake your medications as prescribed every day.\nReport changes in symptoms promptly.\n\u201c2009 Focused update incorporated into the ACC/AHA 2005 guidelines for the diagnosis and management of heart failure in adults: A report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines.

The house was framed by the Amish from Montana, the MDS and United Methodists finished the interior.\nFrom left, Linda Robinson, Clint Baker and Nancy Baker are among the volunteers providing meals and shelter to residents finding refuge from wildfires at Pateros Community United Methodist Church in Washington.\nLast summer, a wildfire scorched the back of Pateros Community United Methodist Church in Washington State and burned down its parsonage.\nThis August, as fires once again devastate the drought-plagued western U.S., the church in Pateros is open 24 hours a day to those in need of shelter, food and a place to escape the smoke.\nVolunteers from throughout the denomination\u2019s Pacific Northwest Conference, which encompasses Washington and 10 counties in the northern panhandle of Idaho, have been assisting \u201cfrom Day 1,\u201d said Jim Truitt, who has served as the conference\u2019s United Methodist Volunteers in Mission disaster response coordinator for the past nine years.\nThe United Methodist Committee on Relief recently distributed wildfire-related emergency grants to both the Pacific Northwest and California-Nevada conferences.\nSparked by lightning without rain and aided by high winds and tinder-dry brush and trees, single fires in Chelan, Douglas and Okanogan counties have merged into \u201ccomplex\u201d infernos.\nEven before that point, the Washington wildfires claimed the lives of three firefighters with the U.S. Forest Service and injured four others when shifting flames overtook a fire crew Aug. 19 after their vehicle had crashed.\nOne of them, Andrew Zajac, 26, was the son of the Rev. Mary Zajac, senior pastor at Baker Memorial United Methodist Church in St. Charles, Illinois, and her husband, Jim Zajac. The family, including his wife, Jennifer, released a video statement about him.\nRichard \u201cRick\u201d Wheeler, 31, was a member of First United Methodist Church in Wenatchee, Washington, where the pastor, the Rev. Joanne Coleman Campbell, comforted his wife, Celeste, after she received news of his death.\nTom Zbyszewski, 20, the third firefighter who died, had just finished his sophomore year at Whitman College in Walla Walla and was spending his second summer with the U.S. Forest Service, where his parents also have worked.\nA memorial service for all three firefighters is planned at 1p.m. Sunday, Aug. 30, in Wenatchee.\nResidents evacuating from those fires to the north and the Chelan Complex fire to the south have fled to Pateros and Brewster, where the Red Cross has opened a shelter.\nMost of the people currently seeking shelter at the church are from the north and came with animals that aren\u2019t allowed at the Red Cross shelter. As of mid-day on Aug. 25, three families were in residence, but the numbers fluctuate. \u201cIn 20 minutes, I could have 50 people at the door,\u201d Lane said.\nTruitt dispatched six clergy and lay persons to Pateros last week to offer support and \u201csimply provide a presence\u201d until the fire chaplains could arrive. He delivered some needed supplies \u2014 underwear, toothpaste and gas cards \u2014 to the church shelter over the weekend.\nPart of the anxiety, Truitt said, is that it often takes a long time to learn what has been lost or saved. \u201cThe fires are so severe and the smoke is so thick the assessors simply can\u2019t tell them the status of their homes,\u201d he explained.\nJust a year ago, the Carlton Complex fire was the largest wildfire in state history and volunteers continue to work on long-term recovery plans.\nOn Aug. 23, the first two of 11 houses to be rebuilt this year were dedicated even as smoke filled the air, said Truitt, who participated in the ceremony.\n\u201cThe Amish poured the foundation and framed the house and the Mennonites finished the inside with some help from the Methodists,\u201d he wrote on the conference\u2019s UMVIM Facebook page.\nThe Rev.

Since you are set to consider the topic, I'd advise you to consider both Emerson and Wm. James on this topic. How freedom consorts with necessity and causation is about the deepest side of the matter.\nIt cannot be doubted that each of us is able to do some of what we want to do, though also always unable to do some of what we want to do. In some degree we are also each able to change our wants and desires--though not always. I think that is about as much freedom as it makes sense to want, though we notice, too, that it is sometimes possible for us to come to be able to do what we were not able to do before. The power of thought is important in this. So, I conclude that we are free, in a sensible meaning of the term, though we are each also always constrained by circumstance --and physical law.\nFreedom is not magical, though it is quite powerful when we learn to accept its reality. We contain in ourselves the same elements that power the universe, and we are capable of thought and action. When we understand the constraints or law and circumstance, we become able to change things by use of this knowledge.\nBe careful, I advise, of equating freedom with something magical. Keep it naturalistic. We must work at being free. On the other hand, avoid the equation of necessity and constraint with fatalism and acquiescence in external control or manipulation--or with determination by some internal state of character or disposition of soul and body. In that direction one finds the well-worn path of original sin and depravity--which the founders of Unitarianism fought against and freed us from.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T10:49:48Z", "url": "https://www.philauu.org/events/is-free-will-an-illusion", "byte_size": 2678, "char_size": 2678}

Be sure to watch the video as well as browse through the photos as mom tells what happened from her perspective.\nBen\u2019s parents were already at the hospital for an induction. Last checked, she was 2 cm dilated and not in active labour at all. The induction medication hadn\u2019t even begun. I normally come when a client is in active labour as this early period could be slowed down by my presence. I texted with dad who told me we would touch base in an hour. I texted to see how things were going. Heard nothing for about 10 minutes and just had this gut feeling. I threw on my scrubs. My gear was already at the house and my childcare had been called in. I knew it would be today just not sure when.\nUtter disbelief. What was he talking about? She wasn\u2019t even in labour. This was a first baby. Complete as in completely dilated and at a 10? Maybe dad wasn\u2019t familiar with the terms.\nI put my keys in my pocket.\nI screamed at my childcare \u201cI gotta go, bye, I\u2019m walking out, you are on duty, bye\u201d and walked right to the car. I was driving away a minute later.\nThe drive had my heart pumping like never before. I knew this could go either way, some first time moms push for one to two hours so I might have time. Some deliver with in a couple pushes. I parked in exactly 20 minutes from when I walked out my door (went back and checked all my text time stamps).\nI ran up to maternity and heard a baby crying from a delivery room. My heart sank. I knew.\nHe was laying on her chest and it was the first natural birth that ever beat me to it!\nThis was a precipitous labor, which is defined as a labor that lasts no more than three hours from onset of regular contractions to delivery. Maybe you could call hers ultra-precipitous?\nThe room no less, was full of peace, and with in the first minute of being there I began shooting. The looks of disbelief and utter joy were plastered all over their faces.\nBen\u2019s parents have graciously allowed me to share their birth in part to glorify God publicly for his miraculous life. The images chosen, many that are not in the video, I selected almost all black and white because in this case, its just so visually stunning when laid together.

{"text": "A row of identically-shaped perfume bottles are all turned so that the labels face away from me.\nAs I struggle to give coherent answers to a series of questions about the first fragrances I remember, my preferences in accessories and fashion, my lifestyle and habits, I can\u2019t help feeling a little sceptical.\nI own nothing with a designer label and my own ideas of my personal style are hazy at best. And besides, no fragrance smells horrible, so surely I am bound to like whatever is selected for me.\nI am attending a fragrance profiling session with Kris Dembinsky, Head of Global Sales for Penhaligon\u2019s, an English perfume house whose fragrances are now available in the Cayman Islands, exclusively at Le Visage in Camana Bay.\nFounded in 1870 by Cornish barber William Penhaligon, the brand keeps the unorthodox spirit of its creator alive.\nStaying firmly out of the mainstream, Penhaligon\u2019s follows its own quirky, individual path.\nIt is not just the exclusivity that sets Penhaligon\u2019s apart from the masses (you will not find these fragrances in high street department stores \u2013 try Harrods or Saks Fifth Avenue instead) but also their tradition of going against the grain: Penhaligon, court barber and perfumer to Queen victoria, was working in an era characterised by prudence and austerity; his style however was flamboyant, exotic and unorthodox \u2013 something which shone through in the fragrances he created.\nHis first fragrance, Hammam Bouquet, was inspired by the Turkish bath house adjacent to his barber shop.\nIt was designed to capture the hot steaminess and exoticism of the hammam.\nThe fragrance is still sold today, an impressive tale of longevity, considering that nowadays around 300 new fragrances hit department store shelves each year, and within two years 85 per cent of these have been discontinued.\nEvery perfume created at Penhaligon\u2019s has its own unique story.\nRather than creating a fragrance to go with a mass marketing campaign, at Penhaligon\u2019s perfumers are given free rein to take their inspiration from places, people and activities.\nThe most recent fragrance, Sartorial, was inspired by a tailor\u2019s workroom in London\u2019s Savile Row and captures the smells and materials of the room: fabric, paper patterns, beeswax and chalk.\nAs Penhaligon\u2019s reputation and his appeal to the upper classes spread, he began to receive requests for bespoke fragrances.\nBlenheim Bouquet was created for the Duke of Marlborough in 1902 and, typically breaking with tradition, Penhaligon came up with the first citrus based fragrance to be produced in England.\nUp until then, fragrances had all been dense, heavy and musky, designed to overpower the unpleasant odours of Victorian London.\nThis light, refreshing fragrance continues to be a best seller today.\nThis quintessentially English brand has continued to create fragrances favoured by the aristocracy, receiving two Royal Warrants \u2013 marks of recognition awarded by members of the Royal Family who have been supplied with the company\u2019s goods or services.\nThe iconic plain glass bottles, the old-fashioned paper labels and the very names \u2013 Elisabethan Rose, Racquets Formula, Jubilee Bouquet \u2013 all seem to evoke images of British gentility.\nInterestingly however, although many of the fragrances are steeped in history, they do not smell in any way out-dated.\nDembinsky selects a number of fragrances for me to try out.\nDespite my earlier conviction that I was bound to like them all, I actually reject the first two immediately.\nThe next two I like, and the last one I don\u2019t.\nI realise I don\u2019t actually know the right words to describe what I smell, but one seems sweet and cloying, another too \u2018pink\u2019 and flowery, the last too harsh.\nHaving narrowed down the \u201cfamilies\u201d of fragrances my preferences lie in, I am then offered some alternatives from the families I like.\nThe concept of fragrance profiling has been around for some time, but the practice has really been perfected in the last two years.\nAt Penhaligon\u2019s staff are trained as \u2018fragrance specialists\u2019 rather than sales people and are experts on both their own range of perfumes, and other brands.\nDembinsky emphasises that it is important that specialists do not ask questions about the specific smells someone likes, but rather aim to build up a picture of the client\u2019s personality, style and outlook.\nThe perfume names are kept hidden from view, lest you be influenced by them, or the associations you make with them.\nMy final choice turns out to be Quercus.\nI couldn\u2019t have told you off the bat why I liked this particular one, but when I learn the name is Latin for oak, and that it was inspired by the strength and solidity of those trees, I think maybe I do smell wood, foliage and the cool, fresh smell of a forests.\nA further dimension of the brand\u2019s unconventional approach is the fact that fragrances are not designed specifically for men or for women, and indeed my preferred choice is purchased by both genders in equal proportions.\nThe profiling service is available through the website www.penhaligons.com, where you can answer a series of questions and within a few days will receive a personalised email (not an automated response) suggesting two or three fragrances you will like.\nYou can then drop into Le Visage to try them out, or, even better you can now be fragrance profiled right in the store.\nPenhaligon\u2019s has expanded over the years and now offers a range of bath oils, shower gels, soaps, body lotions, candles and more.\nAnother service they offer, and something you can practice at home, is fragrance layering.\nThe idea is that you first wash with the scented soap, oil, or gel, then moisturise with a lotion of the same smell, follow this with a dusting of talcum powder and finish off with a spray of the perfume.\nBy creating layers of the same basic scent on the skin, it creates a noticeable depth of fragrance.\nI had a mini-version of this done on my hands and at the end of the day I am still inhaling deeply and day dreaming of clean air and shadowy woodlands\u2026.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T20:39:52Z", "url": "https://www.caymancompass.com/2011/02/20/a-perfume-perfect-for-you/", "byte_size": 6080,

{"text": "This article is part of an ongoing series exploring the response to the global refugee crisis by The Episcopal Church and its ecumenical and interfaith partners. Other articles in the series are available here.\n[Episcopal News Service] When Regan du Closel visited Calais\u2019 infamous \u201cJungle\u201d in October, she was deeply disturbed by the conditions in the makeshift refugee camp. Then as she learned more about the refugees \u2013 some of whom routinely risked their lives in the hope of one day reaching the U.K. \u2013 it was clear that to them this temporary shelter, however miserable, was better than most of the alternatives.\nMost of all, Closel was struck by their strength and dignity as survivors.\nSo when news broke that the French authorities had begun dismantling parts of the camp in early March, and that many of the Jungle\u2019s 6,000 refugees would be evicted, Closel knew she needed to respond.\n\u201cThe partial closing of the Jungle \u2026 is a source of tension, anguish, and misunderstanding to many of the refugees,\u201d said Closel, a lay member at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Paris, where she and fellow parishioner Thomas Girty have organized a compassionate and material response to the needs of refugees arriving in France after fleeing persecution and civil war in their home countries.\nTo find out exactly what is happening and what is needed the most, Closel stays in regular contact with Christian Hogard, a lifelong resident in the Calais area who has made it his vocation to support refugees since 1999 when a Red Cross reception center opened at the Port of Calais mainly to house and process those escaping conflict in the Balkan countries of Eastern Europe.\n\u201cBy working with Christian, who works directly with the central clearing house on the ground up there, we had a pretty good chance of targeting where the need is greatest. [He] is a man of boundless energy, organization and imperturbable courage,\u201d said Closel.\nAs the shacks and tents in the Jungle are razed, some 1,500 people are being moved into a neighboring government camp of shipping containers, Closel explained. Another 1,500 are being moved by bus 25 miles down the Channel coast to a new camp on the outskirts of Dunkirk run exclusively by humanitarian organizations. People there are housed in spartan wooden huts.\n\u201cTo hustle them along, police and smugglers have torched many makeshift shelters and vehicles,\u201d she said.\nAmong the vehicles that have been destroyed is a first-aid van purchased with donations from parishioners and friends of the American Cathedral in Paris and blessed by Convocation Bishop Pierre Whalon and Cathedral Dean Lucinda Laird, who visited the Jungle before Christmas.\nIn the new government camp, the refugees are housed by nationality in shipping containers with bunk beds, electricity and heating, but there are no showers and only cold running water, Closel said.\nThe Dunkirk camp has no cooking facilities and the French government will no longer provide any meals for the refugees, so all food is to be funded by donations and provided by nongovernmental organizations. Likewise, the cost of medical supplies and the local housing and transport for the volunteer medical staff is being covered only by donations.\nClosel and Girty, who is head of mission and outreach at the American Cathedral, have organized an emergency drive for material donations to help refugees in the Dunkirk camp, culminating on Palm Sunday.\nThe American Cathedral in Paris, a parish in the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe, runs and supports several ministries that are responding to the needs of refugees and asylum seekers in France.\nThe Love in a Box ministry, headed by lay Episcopalian Judy Nicault, has for more than a decade distributed gifts at Christmas time for orphans and disadvantaged children throughout Europe. In 2015, Love in a Box delivered more than 3,000 gifts and focused part of its effort on reaching out to the children and unaccompanied minors living in the Jungle.\nThe cathedral also supports the Association d\u2019Entraide aux Minorit\u00e9s d\u2019Orient (Association to Support Eastern Minorities) that helps the French government identify candidates eligible for asylum. Through that program, weekly French language classes help refugees acclimate to their new lives in Paris.\nWhalon and Iraqi businessman Elish Yako set up the association in 2007. Although it has largely focused on resettling Iraqi Christian refugees, in the past three years it has helped many Syrian minorities escaping persecution.\nLike the American Cathedral, other Episcopal parishes and missions throughout Europe don\u2019t see their response to the world\u2019s worst refugee crisis since World War II as short term.\nEpiscopalians in Brussels, Munich, Rome, Wiesbaden and other places are serving the needs of refugees both through long-standing programs and new ministries that continue to evolve as the crisis evolves.\nWith the dismantling of the Calais camp and border closures implemented between Greece and Macedonia, one of the main transit points for refugees entering Europe, the challenges are far from over. Meanwhile, the fears of what the influx of refugees will mean for Europe\u2019s security only seems to be intensifying.\nClosel identifies as someone who has always been at the crossroads between cultures, considered European in the United States and not quite French in France.\nBorn in Geneva, Switzerland, to American parents, she lived in Paris from age 2 to age 8, and was baptized at the American Cathedral. For the next 20 years she lived in the U.S. and returned to France, where she has lived and worked for the past 30 years.\nThe most recent updates from Episcopal Relief & Development about its response to the refugee crisis, as well as ways to donate, are available here.\nEpiscopal Migration Ministries, the refugee resettlement service of the Episcopal Church, works with local resettlement partners, congregations, and individual volunteers to welcome refugees to the United States from the world\u2019s most war-torn places.\n\u2013 Matthew Davies is an editor/reporter of the Episcopal News Service.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T14:56:34Z", "url": "https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/2016/03/16/as-refugees-face-fresh-challenges-episcopalians-in-france-step-up-response/", "byte_size": 6144, "char_size": 6103}

There\u2019s LOADS to choose from, from a ride on the London Eye, to aquarium and zoo tickets and more.\nWe planned our own action-packed family weekend in London to try the offer out, selecting the London Transport Museum as our chosen attraction. On Friday evening, we all piled onto the train, arranged our snacks on the table, and chatted away happily until we arrived into London just in time for dinner.\nOne Aldwych is situated just two blocks from Covent Garden in the heart of theatreland.\nA gorgeous 5 star hotel with stunning amenities, One Aldwych is a great family option as they offer the option of adjoining rooms so that everyone can get a good night\u2019s sleep.\nOur room was up on the third floor and was frankly breathtaking.\nDown a hallway we had the children\u2019s bedroom to the left with twin beds and en suite, the master bedroom to the right, also with ensuite, a well-stocked kitchenette to the side of the corridor, and at the end, a spacious living area with dining table and views right over central London.

Divine!\nCheck availability and book your meal at onealdwych.com/food-drink/indigo.\nIn the morning, we woke early to enjoy our gorgeous suite before heading back to Indigo for breakfast, which is included in the room price for most bookings.\nAlongside a fresh basket of pastries and plenty of hot tea/coffee and juice for the kids, we were presented with a good range of options on the menu.\nI enjoyed an excellent vegetarian cooked breakfast, while Mark opted for the meaty version and the kids enjoyed cereal and pancakes.\nWell stocked with carbs for the day ahead, we left our bags with reception and headed out to explore the area.\nWe hadn\u2019t been walking long when we spotted that J had rather covered herself in maple syrup, so we took a detour to GAP Kids and soon had her kitted out in the outfit, which I think she carries off rather brilliantly.\nWe strolled about, taking note of our theatre when we spotted it, then headed into the piazza to enjoy some live performances and a bit more shopping. The kids loved and J didn\u2019t want to stop watching the man who put his whole body through a coat hanger!\nOn the other side of Covent Garden, we reached the London Transport Museum. Using the 2-for-1 voucher we\u2019d printed was easy. Children go free, so we just presented our voucher along with our train tickets, and paid entry of \u00a317 instead of \u00a334. Brilliant!\nJD and I had visited the London Transport Museum before, but it was J and Mark\u2019s first time and it was wonderful to see how much everyone enjoyed it. Across one main floor and two mezzanines, there are a huge number of exhibits and most are interactive, from buses to taxis and tube trains and even a horse and carriage!\nEach child who visits is given a \u2018Stamper Trail\u2019 card, which allows them to collect 13 stamps from numbered points all over the building. It\u2019s a brilliant way to keep kids interested right through the trip, and ensured we visited every corner of the museum.\nThe kids weren\u2019t all that excited when I told them we were nipping back to the hotel for lunch. That is, until they discovered it was a Charlie and the Chocolate factory themed afternoon tea, their expectations were instantly raised sky high..and One Aldwych exceeded them!\nWe started with these stunning bubbling dry ice cocktails, delivered in glass teapots, they completely captured our imagination.\nThen it was time for the savoury course, little sandwiches and quiches, divided into plates to suit Mark (a meat-eater), the kids, and me (a veggie). It was all perfect \u2013 especially the crumbly heritage tomato tart.\nNext came the sweet course, and the children\u2019s eyes were as round as saucers as treat after treat appeared, from blueberry loaves, to conserves and scones, to gingerbread cake pops, candy floss, golden eggs filled with cheesecake, and more! Everything tasted exceptionally good \u2013 in fact I\u2019d say this quite possibly tops the list of my very favourite food experiences to date.\nWith full tummies and happy hearts, we rounded off this magical treat with hot chocolates, before dashing off to the theatre.\nBook your One Aldwych afternoon tea at onealdwych.com/food-drink/afternoon-tea. Prices start from \u00a337.50 (or \u00a327.50 for children under the age of 12).\nThe kids had never seen a West End musical before so we were so excited to head back into the heart of London\u2019s theatreland to see a full performance of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\nThe sets, characters and performances in the show were loud, proud and larger than life. We enjoyed every second of this clever show, which boasts original songs and dialogue you won\u2019t have seen in the movies, expertly performed by a highly skilled, pitch perfect and completely engaging cast.\nThe ending, without giving too much away, was beautifully done. I highly recommend going to see this show \u2013 the kids loved it and are already talking about going to see it again before it moves to Broadway in 2017.\nFollow Charlie and the Chocolate factory on Facebook and Twitter and book your tickets from \u00a325 at www.charlieandthechocolatefactory.com.\nOn a high from a truly wonderful weekend, we whizzed back to the hotel, grabbed our bags and then made our way to the station for the train ride home. The children both slept on the journey north, as did Mark and I!\nWe\u2019ll definitely be having another London adventure soon and will certainly take advantage of the Thameslink 2 for 1 offers. It\u2019s a brilliant way to get the most of a trip to the big city. What\u2019s more, the 2 for 1 offer is also available across Cambridge & Brighton, so that\u2019s lots more reasons to hop on a train.\nThis is a commissioned post for Thameslink & Great Northern, who provided train and museum tickets.We attended the show and stayed at the hotel as guests of the press offices. The final three Charlie and the Chocolate Factory images are official production images reproduced here with permission.\nAlso thanks to VisitLondon.com for helping us plan the trip. Do check them out for lots more ideas for London family fun.\n\u00ab Noa and Nani has a new collection of \u2018grown up\u2019 furniture and it\u2019s gorgeous!\nLondon Transport Museum is a great, interactive museum that details the history of transit in London. Interesting for kids of all ages!\nMy mouth is watering looking at all of those fabulous food pictures. No matter how many times I go to London, I feel like I only scratch the surface. Thanks for sharing, Emily.\nOh my, that food photography is simply amazing! I feel so discouraged when I see quality photos like yours, since I never seem to be able to produce high quality images.

{"text": "With numerous individuals attempting to make a decent living and TV adverts with infectious jingles enticing you to offer your auto for speedy money, it can appear to be engaging. Your auto (alongside your home) is presumably your most costly bit of value and considering this, it very well may entice offer it, buy a less expensive make or model and pocket the distinction.\nAuto barters, regardless of whether they be physical or on-line, can be a decent method for offering your auto, safe in the information that an accomplished barker has yours, and the closeout house's, best enthusiasm on the most fundamental level. You may surmise that these things don't in every case fundamentally go as one yet remember that the sale house will take a level of the price tag (purchasers charge) as commission so it is to their greatest advantage to get you however much cash as could be expected!\nWhat is an auto sell off?\nAuto barters include a long history inside the car business with a wide range of kinds of business utilizing them to either offer abundance stock or buy new stock for resale.\nThey are to a great degree well known in the USA and Japan and are picking up ubiquity in the UK where they are never again observed as messy spots. This is primarily because of the business attempting to change the notoriety of the part and make it all the more engaging all individuals, not only those 'in the exchange'.\nAuto barters offer autos, business vehicles, cruisers, plant gear, and some of them will likewise offer huge products vehicles and conceivably processions and RVs.\nCloseout houses don't claim the vehicles which they offer. They only go about as a shop front for various sorts of vender. These can incorporate renting organizations, armada administration organizations, merchant gatherings, banks and money related establishments, legislative bodies, police, and obviously private people.\nRenting organizations lease vehicles to organizations or private drivers for a set timeframe (once in a while as meager as 1 year) so the vehicles put into sale are typically youthful models with a decent mileage and in light of the fact that the autos are generally rented from new, they may have just had one individual driving them while heading off to a gathering two times per week! At the point when the rent or rental period closes, renting organizations will enter their old stock into closeout as their clients are more keen on renting shiny new vehicles. These organizations are typically possessed by banks or budgetary establishments.\nThese are like Leasing organizations in that they rent their stock to associations yet vary in that they will supply their clients with an entire armada of autos and deal with that armada for the benefit of their customer. Once more, when the rental time frame for the armada closes, the organizations wish to exploit the capital wrapped up in their stock with the end goal to supplant it with new models.\nOn the off chance that you have ever part traded your old auto at one of the extensive, glass fronted merchants or showrooms, odds are it has in this way been put into closeout and sold. Merchant gatherings will likewise enter old or unsold stock (known as overage) from their forecourts with the end goal to keep their showrooms looking new with the most recent that the manufacturer(s) bring to the table. Obviously, purchasing a vehicle at sale which has been entered by a merchant gathering can be somewhat less secure than the renting or armada organizations as though somebody has part traded their old auto, you need to ask yourself for what valid reason did they do it, what kind of individual where they, how well did they keep it and what number of past managers has it had?\nBanks and money related organizations can fall into armada and renting organizations the same number of them include these components inside their individual corporate families and pursue similar patterns. In any case, banks can likewise enter autos into closeouts that have been repossessed from their clients after defaults on advance or home loan reimbursements. Clearly an auto itself is of practically zero enthusiasm to a bank, they are just intrigued by the esteem and the cash which can be produced using it.\nGovernment bodies will run armadas of autos for their staff and key officials and will refresh this armada all the time with the old stock being put into closeout. Separate Government offices will likewise enter an extensive variety of vehicles at closeout from ex-safeguard Land Rovers or staff autos, to grass cutters and diggers utilized on the neighborhood playing fields or in the nearby burial ground! Neighborhood Government may likewise enter autos into sale that have been seized by bailiffs pursue non installment of bills, for example, Council Tax (contingent upon the Local Authority being referred to, these can be very top of the line models).\nPolice powers will sell vehicles seized from sentenced hoodlums to either repay unfortunate casualties, separate an illicit home or recapture open cash picked up falsely. The police likewise sell off an assortment of different things seized for comparable reasons and may do this through a bartering house or by holding their very own property barters. And also these parcels, all police powers will likewise run an armada of covert or plain vehicles and these should be continually refreshed, with the old stock being put into sale to raise assets for the power.\nThis is the class of vender that we are extremely intrigued by. Private venders can enter and buy autos from closeout and if their auto isn't sold first time round, they can advise the sale house to continue placing it in until the point when they get a satisfactory offer. Be cautioned however, closeout houses will charge you for each time they enter the auto so on the off chance that you have sold your auto after a few deals, you might need to check your hold cost or reconsider your choices.\nMost sales take a shot at a similar main; your imminent purchasers offer against each other, raising the sum which they offer with each new offer they make until the point when their rivals drop out and they are left as the most astounding bidder. The majority of your bidders will be in the bartering lobby (despite the fact that an online component is getting to be expanding mainstream) and all offers are made in the open. This sort of closeout is known as an 'English Auction and its equation applies to the lion's share of vehicle barters.\nAt the point when your vehicle touches base at the bartering focus, it will be investigated by the closeouts professionals who will feature any scratches, imprints, scrapes, rust, and so on and esteem the general harm costs. It very well may be essential to consider this when you consider your hold exchange purchasers will have a smart thought of the vehicles esteem and of the harm costs and will figure this their offering. The harm cost won't be appeared to any purchasers, it is only for the bartering house's records.\nYour auto will then be shot and 'lotted', the procedure whereby your auto is gone into a deal. It will be allocated significantly number and will be put in the closeouts yard to be seen by the purchasers.\nIn the meantime, your vehicles points of interest will be distributed online for purchasers to take a gander at before they touch base at the bartering. This is a decent method for building enthusiasm for your auto and most sale houses will send our duplicates of their most recent indexes to their purchasers.\nThese things are critical to purchasers and on the off chance that you were purchasing an auto, you would hope to have everything that you could have identifying with it so think about these when you enter your auto.\nObviously, you will likewise need to leave your key and any extras with the closeout.\nAt the point when your vehicle is arranging to be crashed into the closeout corridors, purchasers will begin to take a gander at the auto, searching for any harm and they may open the ways to take a gander at the inside. Purchasers are not generally permitted to test drive autos or look under the hood so this procedure of conclusive assessment is critical to them.\nWhen your auto is set up before the barker, the autos subtle elements and any uncommon highlights, for example, additional inside highlights, amalgam wheels, and so forth, will be perused to the gathering of people. The barker will then begin the offering with an opening offer beneath your hold. On the off chance that there is a lot of enthusiasm for your auto, offers can rise quick with numerous individuals contending. In the end, the barker may drop the increments in size to sums that the last couple of bidders feel more good with. This could imply that you see increments of \u00a350 for your auto instead of the \u00a3500s you were seeing comfortable begin. The purchaser with the last most noteworthy offer has now purchased your auto as long as their most noteworthy offer was over your hold. Now the purchaser has gone into a legitimate contract.\nIn the event that the last most astounding offer did not exactly meet your hold, the salesperson may class this a temporary offer and the closeout will then endeavor to consult among you and the purchaser. Now, you can request more cash or request that your hold be met. On the off chance that you go too high and the purchaser hauls out, the deal will fail to work out. It is an exercise in careful control between what the purchaser is set up to offer and the base sum you will acknowledge.\nOn the off chance that you achieve an understanding, the deal will experience as typical.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T14:16:32Z", "url": "http://www.bestluxurycarbrands.com/2018/10/selling-your-car-at-auction-beginners.html", "byte_size": 9669, "char_size": 9667}
{"text": "Living overseas as an American has it\u2019s great points but sometimes it has a lot of challenges that you don\u2019t think about. For instance, most of the rest of the world uses the Metric system. Which makes a lot of sense as the Metric system is much simpler and easier to remember.\nThat said, if you grew up in America, you likely don\u2019t have the foggiest idea how hot or cold it is when someone gives you a temperature in Celsius. Stay with me here and we\u2019re going to have a quick math lesson so that you can do a basic conversion in your head. Then you won\u2019t look silly having to ask if it is hot or cold the next time someone gives you a forecast.\nDouble the temperature in Celsius and add 30.\nIf someone says it was 30 degrees Celsius then you simply double it (to 60) and add another 30 to get 90. 30 degrees Celsius is pretty hot.\nIf it\u2019s only 10 degrees Celsius then double it (to 20) and add another 30 to get 50. A bit chilly.\nIf you\u2019re like us and live in the frigid North and someone tells you it\u2019s going to be -30 degrees this weekend, double it (-60) and add 30 to find out it\u2019s\u2026really stinkin\u2019 cold outside.\nIncidentally the further you get from freezing the less accurate this is so don\u2019t use this rule for cooking unless you want some unpleasant surprises.\nAsking questions of those who have \u201cbeen there\u201d is a great way to prepare yourself for the crazy adventure that is moving to China. Even though you can never be completely prepared for such a drastic change, knowing what to expect goes a long way to making the transition much smoother. I was so thankful to have a fellow expat friend who generously fielded numerous questions before our move. It was such a huge help to us, and one of the main reasons I decided to start this blog. I recently received a question from a reader, and I thought I\u2019d share the questions and response in case it helps someone else in a similar situation.\nMy family has LOVED all the information we have learned from reading all of your posts. I\u2019m sure we haven\u2019t gotten through everything yet, but we are learning from it. If all goes according to plan we (my husband and I, as well as our 3 kids) will be moving to Shenyang the beginning of 2012. I was hoping that ya\u2019ll could help me with a few questions. For one, I wondered what host site you use for your blog? The one you guys have set up is exactly what we would like to have in place.\nSecond, how hard has it been to stay connected technology wise? Like I said, we have 3 kids. I have read that there are ways around the government blocks online, but I have read so many positive and negative things now that I\u2019m just confused. It is very important to us to try to keep our technology connections so that our kids don\u2019t feel completely cut off. At this point we don\u2019t even know whether to purchase computers from the US before we leave or China once we get there. We really want to be able to contact family and share all the adventures they are having.\nAgain, we have really enjoyed reading about all of your experiences (although I gotta say I literally gagged last night reading about the taxi driver chewing on his hack!!! I already know that the first time I hear that sound and realize what it is\u2026.I will most likely puke! Oh well, that will just be another story to share, lol) We look forward to any future posts and any information you guys can share with us.\nI recently received a question from a reader asking for advice and insight on their upcoming move to Shenyang. I thought the question and response might be helpful for someone else as well, so with permission I\u2019ve posted our correspondence. If you\u2019re currently on expat assignment and have something else to add, I\u2019d love for you to chime in on the subject in the comments. If you\u2019re not yet an expat but also have questions, feel free to ask away and I or my fellow expats will try to fill in with what we\u2019ve learned so far.\nThe more information we can share, the better off we\u2019ll all be.\nHi. My husband and I just returned from a job interview in Shenyang. The company flew both of us over for a look-see and interview. We were there for 3 days. (I know, who goes all the way to China and stays for just 3 days?) The work would likely be in both Shenyang and Yingkou, or perhaps mainly in Yingkou. It would be a 2-3 year contract.\nI\u2019d appreciate any advice you\u2019d like to share. My husband is supposed to let the company know what he wants for compensation and benefits. Are there benefits you\u2019d recommend asking for? What about Chinese taxes? Are there employers who pay taxes for their employees? We saw that the marginal rate goes up to 45%, and then we would owe US taxes as well. I read in China Daily while we were there that foreign workers will now be covered by the Chinese social security, medical and unemployment insurance, to the tune of an additional 11% payroll deduction. That wouldn\u2019t leave much for us!\nWe recognize the challenges we\u2019d face living in China, and think that we can not just manage, but truly come to enjoy the adventure. I\u2019ve enjoyed reading about your experiences, and look forward to having our own China stories to share.\nLB and I finally got the chance to go through some of your questions (I have no idea about a lot of the details like taxes and stuff.) We had a few thoughts on the subject between us. Not sure how it works out with you, but we were pretty fortunate to be sent by an international company who has quite a few expats here already. It was NOT a perfect process by any means (get ready to be flabbergasted over and over\u2026 and make sure you throw any expectations you have out the window. You\u2019ll be much better off for it.) but they do take care of us pretty well. Will you be working for a Chinese company as a foreign expert? Not sure how that will change the process, but it surely will. It is a different culture for sure. Make sure you get it all in writing, but realize even then, that doesn\u2019t always mean a whole lot when you\u2019re dealing with this culture. You\u2019ll still have to ask for things even if they\u2019re in the contract.\nYou\u2019ll want to keep these things in mind at the very least.\n1. Housing: Make sure they are providing you with housing. Most companies do. A budget of 15,000 \u2013 20,000 RMB per month should be sufficient for a furnished apartment or, in some cases a townhouse, in a nice complex/neighborhood although that will likely vary a lot depending on what city you\u2019re in. That will get you a very nice apartment in Shenyang.\nAnother option would be to negotiate a smaller monthly allowance for an unfurnished apartment plus a stipend for purchasing furniture or shipping your own furniture from the States. This was actually the option we chose, and I was really glad we did. It was great to be able to choose my own furniture and design my own home rather than feeling like I was living in someone else\u2019s house. I will say that if it hadn\u2019t been for the new Ikea in Shenyang though, I doubt this option would have worked out as well. Also, I don\u2019t think this is very common in China. Most apartments come furnished, I believe, but it worked out really well for us.\nOur company goes through a realty company who specializes in placing expats (We used KELT. There is alsoCentury 21 in Shenyang). It was a big help dealing with people who speak English and who\u2019s job it is to take care of the lease, dealing with the landlord, getting your proper permits, etc. We also don\u2019t deal with paying the rent at all. That is paid directly by the company. We do pay for utilities though. We\u2019ve been here almost a year and still occasionally contact them with any issues we have with our apartment (like yesterday, when we woke up to no electricity). Our realtor has become a great friend who I call on for all kinds of questions and translating. She was indispensable in the beginning when we were just learning to function here.\nIf they do agree to pay for your housing, make sure you are able to pick your apartment, or at least see where it is they want to put you. The exact apartment. Most apartments are privately owned and one building can have several levels of quality. I would suggest negotiating a \u201chousing allowance\u201d and then shopping for your own place. To me, it is the most important part about making this place feel like home. Especially for you as the wife since you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time there.\n2. Car and driver: I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019ll work out working both in Yingkou and Shenyang but google maps says it is about 2.5 hours drive. If you\u2019ll have to do a lot of commuting back and forth I would definitely make sure you are provided with a car and driver. Inside Shenyang, it is no problem getting around with the buses and plenty of taxis. We don\u2019t have a car and do fine without it, but I think if you\u2019ll be outside the city then you\u2019ll need one.\n3. Language lessons: You need to learn Chinese to really have a good experience here. It\u2019s a difficult language and some people don\u2019t bother learning it but I think you have a much less frustrating experience when you can break down the communication barrier even just a little. I would suggest asking for a set language budget or set number of hours of tutoring for both you and your husband. I think the companies I\u2019ve heard of usually offer 100 hours.\n4. Moving costs: Negotiate your shipping and moving costs. You\u2019ll probably need at least an air freight container. They come in several sizes. Another option is a sea freight container. They are much larger and are typically used if you want to bring your furniture from home. They take much longer to arrive however.\n5. Vacation time: This one has been a big issue for us. If you\u2019re going to want to travel a lot (and there is so much to see in Asia!) make sure you have enough time to take off to do it. I think you need at least 20 days, probably 25 would be better.\n6. Home flights: Will they pay for you to take a trip home once a year or twice a year? For both of you? If so, do you get extra days to compensate for the travel time or will you have to take vacation days? Something to think about considering it takes 3 days of traveling to get to the States and back.\n7. Taxes: This is the one I\u2019m not so sure about. You are responsible for taxes in both China and the US. You\u2019ll definitely need to hire a professional to take care of all the taxes. I would make sure that is also paid for by the company. Most companies here take responsibility for paying the Chinese taxes. (I\u2019m not sure about the China Social Security thing, haven\u2019t heard anything about that.) Our company takes care of all the taxes here and our pay stays the same. They also offset the taxes in the US so that we pay the same as we would if we were still employed in the US. One other thing to remember is that all of the benefits they pay for such as your car and driver, your housing, etc. is considered taxable income by the US government even though it isn\u2019t showing up in your bank account. Add it all up and that first tax bill will make your eyes pop out of your head.\n8. Getting paid: You want to get paid in the US if possible. There are two ways it is done here. One company that I know of pays 75% of your income in the US and 25% in Chinese RMB. Even at 25% most people don\u2019t spend that much and end up with lots of RMB left to change at the end. It is a real pain and quite difficult to change money back from RMB to US dollars. Our company pays 100% of our paycheck in to our US account and we then make a wire transfer (reimbursable at 1 per month) to our Chinese bank account in the amount we need. Either way works fine I think. Getting paid 100% in China is usually a huge hassle so I\u2019ve heard.\nSalary: Obviously it depends on the company, but generally, if you work as an expat for a foreign company you can expect your previous salary + 30-50% increase (b/c you have to live without Dunkin Donuts whole bean coffee and JIF peanut butter.) + cost of living adjustment + additional compensations listed above. I would say that most expats come to China for the money. But it is a GREAT experience even without the padding of the bank account!\nI really enjoyed hearing your guesses for the pop quiz. Thanks for playing along!\nWe had a few guesses on the original post, and a few more posted on Facebook.\nPop quiz\u2026 What is this?\nFound this taped to my door.\nWhat is it? What am I supposed to do with it?\nJust a little taste of what it\u2019s like living in a foreign country where you can\u2019t read or speak the language. Every day is an adventure. And the littlest simplest tasks become difficult.\nHint: You get something similar in the US and if I don\u2019t deal with it soon I\u2019m in trouble.\n1. Find the largest pot you have. If you have 2 or 3 large pots it works even better.\n2. Fill the pots with water and place them on the stove.\n4. Heat the water until you start to see bubbles.\n5. Using potholders (or folded up dishrags if like me you still don\u2019t have potholders), carry the pots of water one by one into the bathroom.\n6. Dump the hot water into the tub.\n7. Repeat steps 1-6 until you have enough water in the tub to bathe with. Turn on the faucet to add cool water if the water is too hot.\nHi. Just wanted to let you know we are having a problem with the hot water in the showers. Neither get hotter than luke warm. Definitely not hot enough to take a comfortable shower. The water in the kitchen sink gets quite hot, just not the bathrooms. Can we get this fixed soon?\nI just contacted with the management company and the staff told me the problem has existed about year.\nAfter the management company transformed the pipe system in Wulihe Plaza.\nAnd the problem extensively exist in the Wulihe Plaza.\nBefore the management company transform the pipe system again the problem can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be solved completely.\nBut there is a temporary solution is before you do the shower please call the management company 2388****, they will send a worker to make the water warmer.\nReally? You just want me to call you before I want to take a shower? Every day?\nAnd wait? This is the solution for the WHOLE building? 24 floors of apartments.\nIs there a guy whose sole job is to come heat up the water every time anyone wants to take a hot shower? There has to be. And how does he do it?\nAnd when that doesn\u2019t work: Refer to steps 1-7 above.\nSo\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u2019ve been trying to get out of posting this little story. I mean, you don\u2019t really care to know EVERYTHING that happens to us on this little adventure, do you? Actually, I\u2019m not really sure you care to know any of it, but I\u2019m writing it down just the same. I was going to skim over this tidbit, but I realized\u2026 I just need to keep it real. Most of you already know what a dingbat I am anyway, and it\u2019s probably unlikely you\u2019ll even be surprised I\u2019d do something like this.\nOn Thursday morning, we met the realtor, Echo, at the apartment. She is Chinese, but speaks English ok and was appointed to answer questions and translate for us. When we arrived, a friend of the landlord was also there getting things ready, setting up the phone and internet, etc.\nI went to the kitchen first to check out the appliances and make sure everything was in working order. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this apartment, like the first, had a little TV in the kitchen. Both times, the realtor seemed really excited to show us this. To be honest, the first time I was unimpressed. Who has time to watch TV in the middle of cooking anyway? Besides that, most of the channels are in Chinese and the screen is only 6 inches across. Tiny.\nHowever, I knew from the first apartment that the TV wasn\u2019t just a TV. It was also a security camera! So cool! I know it may not be that exciting to you. But I was impressed.\nWhen I asked Echo about it, she mentioned that this one also had that capability, but she wasn\u2019t quite sure how to work it. She pushed a few buttons and we never could quite figure it out. I got bored for the moment and moved on. When I got back out to the living/ dining area, I noticed another screen mounted on the wall next to the door. I was sure this was a camera too. And I was determined to figure out how to use this thing. Not that I ever think we\u2019ll need it. I don\u2019t. But still, I must know how it works. It\u2019s just the way I am. No gadget can be left untouched.\nThere are 6 buttons on the panel. One of them has to work the camera, right? They are all labeled with Chinese characters, which I can\u2019t read of course, so without rhyme or reason I just decided to push them all until the camera came on. Easy enough.\nThe very first button on the right has red writing, looks the most to me like it would be a power or \u201cOn\u201d button. Wrong! As soon as I pushed it, it starts blinking red and a deafening alarm starts going off. I\u2019m in total \u201cOh Crap\u201d mode and start going down the line pushing every button on there to try and get it to stop. Well, Echo walks up beside me at that point and as I\u2019m going back down the line of buttons, frantically trying to find a combination that would shut the thing up. I start to push the same red button again, and Echo stops me.\nUmmm, WHAT?!? Did you say police??\nSo, I really didn\u2019t know much about China before we moved here (still don\u2019t, as a matter of fact), but the one thing I do know, is you want to steer clear of the police. (That really goes in just about every country, I think.) And I\u2019m pretty sure, you definitely don\u2019t want to call them to you, with a flashing red light and a blaring siren loud enough to wake the dead, for NO REASON! At this point, I\u2019m pretty much mortified. All the while trying to play it off like the siren just started going off by itself or the guy messing with the wiring set it off, and I was just \u201chelping\u201d by pushing buttons to try and shut it off.\nAs it turns out, I had very little to worry about. The alarm continued to go off for over an hour with no sign of the police. The landlord\u2019s friend did manage to reduce it to an intermittent blaring somehow. But it would only stay quiet for about 2 minutes before it would start again. I have to admit, about 45 minutes in, I\u2019m over the panic and getting a little annoyed. What if there really was an emergency? What good is that stupid little thing, except to trick button-happy foreigners into bursting their ear drums?\nWell, someone did eventually come and turn off the alarm. I was conveniently in another room at the time so I didn\u2019t get to see them fix it. I\u2019m not sure exactly how Echo explained the situation but it probably went something like: \u201cThat crazy white woman in there got all geeked out over the security camera. Apparently they don\u2019t have those in Iva.\u201d Yeah well, maybe not. But we have tractors. And cows. Where are your cows?\nOn a side note, none of the buttons actually turned on the security camera. We found out later, it comes on automatically when someone pushes the doorbell.\nSo how do you translate\u2026 ummm, oops?", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T07:05:43Z", "url": "http://www.countryfriedeggroll.com/category/life-in-china/expat-advice/", "byte_size": 19100, "char_size": 18867}

{"text": "A new special report from Microgrid Knowledge and NRG Energy explores trends in local energy and distributed energy resources (DERs). This excerpt takes a look at how market factors have led to the maturity of DER technology.\nDistributed energy used to be simple. Put a generator in a building basement, or solar panels on a roof, and the job was done.\nBut today\u2019s DERs do more than produce generation. As microgrids demonstrate, they\u2019ve become sophisticated management tools for complex combinations of energy resources and can provide a range of new price, environmental and system efficiency benefits.\nHow did this growth in digital intelligence and management capability come about?\nThe path to smart DER technology started a couple decades ago when demand response was a relatively new tool to curtail peak demand on an overtaxed power system. Early on, interruptible rates served as a key enabler for demand response, providing incentives for customers to reduce electricity use. In that scenario, curtailment was driven by radio controls and pagers, relatively primitive technology by today\u2019s standards. As electronics and controls advanced, demand response systems became capable of more automated and precise two-way communications between the grid and individual devices, or loads, on the system.\nTechnological advances in DER technology and their controls, combined with key regulatory changes, spurred further innovation and opened new markets in demand response.\nOrganizations began to realize they also could participate in demand response programs by combining a backup generation source with battery storage and linking them together with advanced electronic controls. Rather than reduce business operations or dim lighting, they could instead curtail use of grid power with an on-site generator. From the grid operator\u2019s perspective, the action produces the same result\u2014 the customer consumes less power when the grid is overtaxed.\nThis approach also opened a new way to minimize utility demand charges. Such charges can be onerous for large energy users because they are set based on their electric usage during a high-cost peak period. By reducing usage at the right time, the organization could lower the charges. Operating on-site generators during this time is one way to do so.\nThe next step was to use more than one generation resource and manage them for greatest economic flexibility. An early microgrid\u2014although it wasn\u2019t yet called that\u2014tended to use a CHP plant that could operate either independently or connected to the grid. Another variation paired the CHP plant with a second form of generation, often a fossil fuel backup generator.\nLater, solar photovoltaics and sometimes wind turbines began to appear in the microgrid generation mix. This trend intensified with a decline in renewable energy costs, coupled with the drive by organizations to achieve sustainability goals.\nDistributed resources plans (DRPs) can lay the groundwork for integrating DERs into a utility\u2019s grid, by delineating hosting capacity on the grid, providing locational values for DERs and streamlining interconnection procedures.\nEnergy storage became the latest addition as battery prices fell. Batteries also proved to be effective energy management tools, charged when electricity prices are low and discharged when prices are high. While batteries are the most common form of storage, a microgrid may also use thermal storage, which can employ a range of mediums such as ice, earth and concrete, to capture and store heating and cooling.\nA market research report from Deutsche Bank predicts that in 2018, the amount of new distributed generation may exceed the amount of new central generation globally. The report estimates that the current 1 GW DER market could grow to over 40 GW by 2022, and by 2023 distributed generation could supplant the need for 320 GW of large-scale power plants. The increase in DERs will, in turn, drive the need for intelligent distribution networks comprised of nanogrids, microgrids and virtual power plants, according to the report.\nDespite their growth, DERs and microgrids face barriers to wider adoption. For example, a microgrid with only diesel generators may risk exceeding legal emissions limits if it runs too long. Financial and regulatory barriers in certain cases may also inhibit DER adoption. Expert opinion varies on the relative importance of those barriers.\nSixty-one percent of utility executives identified capital and financial constraints as the top barrier to DER adoption.\nOnly 46 percent of those executives identified regulations as a barrier.\nSixty-one percent of regulators identified inadequate regulations as the top barrier.\nOnly 33 percent of the regulators saw capital and financial constraints as a problem.\nThis gap in perception highlights some of the challenges the microgrid industry faces in prioritizing reforms that will lead to wider adoption of DER technology.\nOn the financial side, the lack of long-term off-take contracts raises concern. Much of the wholesale electric power in the U.S. is bought and sold on the short-term or spot market, an arena sometimes long on volatility and short on revenue that financiers seek.\nOn the regulatory front, many states lack clear policies on DER integration with the grid. That\u2019s starting to change. Several states, notably California and New York, have adopted policies aimed at DER integration. Similar policies have also been put in place at the federal level with more in the works.\nFormal state requirements for utility adoption of distributed resources plans (DRPs) also assists DER development. DRPs can lay the groundwork for integrating DERs into a utility\u2019s grid, by delineating hosting capacity on the grid, providing locational values for DERs and streamlining interconnection procedures. In a white paper, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory noted that eight states have adopted some form of DRP requirement for their investor-owned utilities.\nMicrogrids and DERs have come of age, offering sophisticated technology and services that energy users both need and want. It is now a matter of regulation, markets and business models catching up. As we\u2019ll see in the next three chapters, this is already happening.\nFor more on the rise of local energy, see the new special report, \u201cThe Evolution of Distributed Energy Resources What the Rise of Local Energy Means for Businesses, Institutions and Communities,\u201d courtesy of NRG, downloadable free of charge.\nare there any 48volt DC DERs?", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T14:19:42Z", "url": "https://microgridknowledge.com/der-technology-microgrids-nrg/?replytocom=533251", "byte_size": 6557, "char_size": 6529}

{"text": "Long synonymous with volatile climes and the obscenely large shoe collections of its past heads of state, Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, is fast coming into its own as a vastly underrated cultural cosmopolis. Manila\u2019s chaotic city traverses the extremes of a truly modern metropolis, while enjoying the best attributes of the bustling boroughs of Brooklyn, the gleaming shopping of Shanghai and the culinary vitality of a city at the heart of a Southeast Asian archipelago where indigenous, Malay, Chinese, Spanish and American influences collide with a rich history, dynamic present and unpredictable future.\nBelow, where to stay, play, wine and dine in one of Asia\u2019s most exciting and unexpected destinations to visit in 2016 and beyond.\nIn the heart of the Bonifacio Global City, a neighbourhood of Manila Metro named for an iconic revolutionary who lead the movement for independence in the Filipino Revolution against Spanish colonial rule, you\u2019ll find the Shangri-La at the Fort. A towering beacon of luxury, the hotel is the pivotal nexus where five-star accommodation meets an unparalleled domestic residence, an all-encompassing leisure centre and world-class cuisine and retail. Situated within easy reach of the international airport, each of the 576 rooms gives way to incredible views of Metro Manila, BGC and the city\u2019s incredible sunsets.\nOn arrival, you\u2019re quickly exposed to a taste of the eclecticism that makes Manila such a fascinating city: the works of Bataan-born artist Jinggoy Buensuceso are emblematic of a thriving arts scene; higher up, the Kerry Sports centre spans over 8,000 square metres and two floors dedicated to recreation and relaxation; and it\u2019s only once you reach the summit that you\u2019ll come to appreciate the city\u2019s nature as a living, breathing organism. From the Horizon Homes showrooms, it\u2019s possible to trace the (notoriously congested) arteries of the city as far as the eye can see, illuminated as they are by the tens of millions of Manile\u00f1os that make the city tick day after day.\nHaving spent a day traversing the city\u2019s labyrinthine streets, you\u2019re assured of a comforting meal and tipple at Raging Bull Chophouse and Bar. Opened this year, Raging Bull Chophouse serves exactly what its name suggests: a smorgasbord of grain and grass-fed dry-aged beef that comes highly-recommended (in addition to an expansive seafood menu) from yours truly. However it\u2019s to the cocktail menu that you\u2019ll want to return. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a libation more restorative than the Bonifacio Penicillin, which, as its name suggests, marries the region\u2019s history with the medicinal properties of a good, stiff drink: bourbon, calamansi extract (a perennial Filipino citrus; think a hybrid of a mandarin and a cumquat), spiced honey and ginger jam.\nShould the prospect of venturing further afoot prove unappetising, you\u2019re able to traverse a world of cuisines at the High Street Caf\u00e9, a cafeteria style eatery where nine \u2018theatre kitchens\u2019 offer a selection of pan-Asian cuisines that square off against Mediterranean, rotisserie, seafood, salad bar and dessert options. Variety, after all, is the spice of life. You\u2019d also be hard pressed to pass up the haute Chinese cuisine on offer at Canton Road, where you\u2019re sure to meet your match in their offering of Cantonese and Huaiyang cuisine.\nNot immune to the global charms of craft beer culture, Manila has fallen head over heels for microbreweries. It\u2019s not hard to see why when you visit the Filipino-style yakitori restaurant, Tambai, in the Makati district\u2019s culinary epicentre, Poblacion. A thriving cultural hub populated by speakeasies hidden behind unassuming facades, Poblacion has fast developed a reputation as the go-to spot for casual drinking and dining \u2013 exemplified most agreeably in the vibe at Tambai (it literally translates to \u2018hang out\u2019 in Tagalog, the local dialect). You can\u2019t go wrong with a Joe\u2019s Brew, a local tipple, that pairs perfectly with a Filipino spin on traditional Japanese yakitori.\nManila is home to some of Southeast Asia\u2019s most exciting young and established artists, and it\u2019s in the city\u2019s galleries and museums \u2013 think the Metropolitan Museum of Manila and the Cultural Centre of the Philippines \u2013 that you\u2019ll find pieces by world-class artists creating work that distils their country\u2019s volatile history into single frame. However, it\u2019s on the streets (and walls) of the city that you\u2019ll get a real indication of the local art scene. Street art is a vibrant and thriving feature of the BGC, with many of the area\u2019s walls and public spaces acting as a canvas for the city\u2019s best and brightest, either in large-scale public sculptures of the kind created by Filipino-American artist, fashion designer and multi-disciplinary creative Dee Jae Pa\u2019este or in the stunning murals preferred by the self-taught Anjo Bolarda.\nOnce you\u2019ve had your fill of looking at exquisitely painted walls, it\u2019s time to look within them and delve into Manila\u2019s complex history. Venture to Intramuros, an incredible walled city and the oldest district in Manila. A stone citadel traversing 64 hectares, Intramuros traces its origins back to 1571 as the seat of Spanish colonial power within the region. Head there early to beat the crowds (and the temperatures) or, conversely, embrace them wholeheartedly.\nAt the time that GRAZIA visited the Intramuros, the school day had come to an end and we were surrounded by children \u2013 warm, friendly and teaming with energy, not unlike the city that raised them.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T11:05:57Z", "url": "https://grazia.com.au/articles/manila-philippines-travel-guide/", "byte_size": 5614, "char_size": 5526}

{"text": "There\u2019s a trick question that rabbis and religious school teachers sometimes like to ask in order to stump their congregants and their students. But I bet there are plenty of you who will get the right answer even though it is sort of tricky. Ready?\nYes, some of you got it \u2013 the answer is Shabbat.\nOf course, Yom Kippur is very important too. And, our little quiz notwithstanding, we all know very well that Yom Kippur --\u2013 and especially the Kol Nidre service that inaugurates it --- is when many synagogues will have their biggest attendance.\nWhat is it that draws us here on this night of all nights?\nMy sense is that what draws us to shul for Yom Kippur is that this is the day each year when, as a Jewish community, we most powerfully confront our sense of mortality.\nIndeed, the language of the ritual confession or \u201cvidui\u201d that is recited at the bedside of a person who is near death is similar to the language of the vidui prayer of the minchah (afternoon service) for Erev Yom Kippur, which I personally recited just a few hours ago.\nAnd the white kittel that I\u2019m wearing to lead services is intended to remind us of a burial shroud.\nKol Nidre night may pull us into shul because it reminds us that we have a limited time on this earth. We can never know with absolute certainty what tomorrow will bring.\nSo it is today/hayom that we must rededicate ourselves to being better partners with God in the healing and repair of our world; and in the healing and repair of ourselves.\nIn Hebrew the same word \u201cavodah\u201d means both \u201cworship\u201d and \u201cservice.\u201d The two are inextricably linked. Our worship \u2013 in prayer and song and public reading of scripture \u2013 should lead us to service. That is the message of this awesome day.\nI\u2019m hoping we will pay particular attention this year to a verse from the Yom Kippur afternoon Torah portion, Leviticus 19:16 to be precise: There we learn -- \u201clo ta\u2019amod al dam reyekha\u201d/ \u201cdo not stand idly by your neighbor\u2019s blood.\u201d (Lev. 19:16).\nThe Talmud explains that the commandment \u201cdo not stand idly by your neighbor\u2019s blood\u201d means that we must not stand and watch a person die when we can do something to save them.\nThis is a lesson that too few people understood as the Shoah unfolded in the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s. This is a lesson that too few people understood as genocide took place in Rwanda in the 1990\u2019s. And nine years ago on Kol Nidre night I was speaking to the congregation in my former congregation in Plattsburgh, NY about not standing idly by while the people of Darfur in western Sudan were being massacred by the central government of their own country.\nGrowing up, and inculcated with the values I absorbed in my own Jewish upbringing, I accepted the notion that the Shoah was totally unique in world history. I no longer agree with that idea. Genocide is genocide, and it makes no difference that in the particular case of the Jewish people during the Nazi era it was the work of white Europeans\u2026.\nI feel I need to mention this because a congregant who I respect very much challenged me a couple of weeks ago when I first mentioned from the bima that I was opposed to President Obama\u2019s plan to bomb Syria. One of the offhand comments I had made at the time was that this was a Syrian civil war, and that Assad was not attacking or threatening to attack the United States (or Israel for that matter).\nBut then he said to me: Well, if the Syrians who were being gassed were Jews would that be different? My instinctive, even reflexive, response to him at that moment was that, yes, that would be different because we, as Jews, have a special responsibility to other Jews. So, in that sense, it would be as if we ourselves were, in fact, being attacked so that this would no longer be just a Syrian internal civil conflict. He then responded that our responsibility really should be to all of humanity.\nOkay, so let me clarify the reflexive answer I gave to him two weeks ago. And that congregant \u2013 He told me I could identify him \u2013 was none other than our Temple president Tom Griggs --- who I do indeed respect very much.\nSo I want to state, \u201cfor the record\u201d that yes, I do believe that \u201clo ta\u2019amod al dam reyekha\u201d / \u201cdo not stand idly by the blood of your neighbor\u201d DOES apply to all of our neighbors on this planet of ours, and that includes the innocent dead of Syria.\n\u201c[\u2026] Congressional delegations, special envoys and humanitarian agencies send back or bring back horror-filled reports from the scene. A million human beings, young and old, have been uprooted, deported. Scores of women are being raped every day, children are dying of disease hunger and violence.\n\u201cHow can a citizen of a free country not pay attention? How can anyone, anywhere not feel outraged? How can a person, whether religious or secular, not be moved by compassion? And above all, how can anyone who remembers remain silent?\n\u201cAs a Jew who does not compare any event to the Holocaust, I feel concerned and challenged by the Sudanese tragedy. We must be involved. How can we reproach the indifference of non-Jews to Jewish suffering if we remain indifferent to another people's plight?\n\u201cIt happened in Cambodia, then in former Yugoslavia, and in Rwanda, now in Sudan. Asia, Europe, Africa: Three continents have become prisons, killing fields and cemeteries for countless innocent, defenseless populations. Will the plague be allowed to spread?\n\"Lo taamod al dam r\u00e9akha\" is a Biblical commandment. \"Thou shall not stand idly by the shedding of the blood of thy fellow man.\" The word is not \"akhikha,\" thy Jewish brother, but \"r\u00e9akha,\" thy fellow human being, be he or she Jewish or not. All are entitled to live with dignity and hope. All are entitled to live without fear and pain.\n\u201cNot to assist Sudan's victims today would for me be unworthy of what I have learned from my teachers, my ancestors and my friends, namely that God alone is alone: His creatures must not be.\n\u201cWhat pains and hurts me most now is the simultaneity of events. While we sit here and discuss how to behave morally, both individually and collectively, over there, in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan, human beings kill and die.\n\u201cShould the Sudanese victims feel abandoned and neglected, it would be our fault - and perhaps our guilt.\n\u201cThat's why we must intervene.\nThe bloodshed has been going on in Syria for two years already --- or decades \u2013 if you want to think of the larger picture of the violent repressive nature of the State led now by Bashar Assad and formerly by his father Hafez Assad.\nBut even if we limit ourselves to the current civil conflict there, we are faced with the fact that atrocities are being committed on both sides, and great moral ambiguity exists regarding the pros and cons of any particular solutions to the conflict. What we do know is that over 100,000 Syrians have died in the last two years of fighting, and that MILLIONS of Syrians have fled the country as refugees.\nAnd the question remains: What is to be done?\nBut on this Yom Kippur 5774, I\u2019m sensing other ways in which today feels like Yom Ke-Purim/ A Day Like Purim. In Megillat Esther there are dizzying twists and turns of plot---- so too this High Holiday season. We\u2019ve gone from the brink of attacking Syria to a new attempt at diplomacy in ways we would not have anticipated less than a week ago. And, depending on your interpretation of recent events, President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have been as inept as King Achashverosh or as astute as Mordechai in their handling of the situation.\nBut that\u2019s the subject of another sermon\u2026.\nIn any event, all the Purimesque plot twists of the past couple of weeks have been particularly challenging for rabbis like me who have been trying to write our High Holiday sermons.\nMy first reaction when President Obama started pushing the idea of attacking Syria was impatience with him for getting tripped up in a \u201cred line\u201d of his own making. But then again, I too find myself tripped up by my own self-imposed \u201cred line\u201d of wanting to do a current-events oriented talk from the bima tonight.\nIn truth, I often feel that way when trying to make connections between Jewish teachings, liturgy and scripture and political issues of the day. From my perspective, Judaism is multi-voiced and the Jewish people are politically diverse. And my general sense is that any of you can read the New York Times or listen to NPR just as well as I can. And this week in particular, I\u2019ve been dealing with data overload \u2013 TMI \u2013 too much information --- as I\u2019ve been seizing onto every new blog post, news report and op-ed essay to try to help me understand what\u2019s going on in Syria and what should be done about it. It has gotten to the point where I have so many news articles and listserve posts from colleagues weighing in on Syria that all these resources have just blurred together and have pretty much become useless to me. So, I\u2019ll just have to try to give you an impressionistic account of my thinking on the subject and see if I can try to couch it in some Jewish teaching appropriate for the holiday.\nViscerally, I\u2019m reminded of the events of 9-11 and their aftermath. We marked the anniversary of that awful day just yesterday. Back then I found myself glued to media reports of the ongoing rush of new developments in the same way that I\u2019ve been doing so in the last couple of weeks about the possibility of the US attacking Syria.\nThe attacks on New York City and Washington, DC and the plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania that was headed to Washington --- took place 12 years ago, but we still, as a nation, carry within ourselves the trauma of that day. If we are reluctant to confront Assad militarily over his use of chemical weapons, the reluctance comes in part from our knowing that Assad\u2019s opponents include significant numbers of extremists allied to the terrorist group that targeted us on 9-11.\nAnd our reluctance comes from remembering the costly and destabilizing legacy of the Iraq War that President George W. Bush instigated in large part by using the events of 9-11 as a phony pretext.\nAnd our reluctance comes from remembering how that war was sold to us as a limited action and so we don\u2019t trust the current administration when it says it too wants authorization only for a limited action.\nAnd we\u2019re confused about what this supposedly limited action is supposed to entail --- more than a pinprick but less than a regime change --- with no real sense of what that actually would entail.\nAnd how can it not turn out to be a slippery slope to being fully mired in a civil war that is not our own?\nAnd our reluctance comes from knowing that there are so many \u201cnation building\u201d needs right here at home that compete for our attention and our dollars.\nWhat is there to say? My first instinct has been the same as that of many others, both Republicans and Democrats: that President Obama\u2019s plan to attack Syria has been more about proving our toughness than about achieving cogent goals. Assad is a brutal dictator, but a US attack on his forces would be an act of aggression against a nation that has neither attacked us nor threatened to attack us.\nAll for what? To defend a \u201crule of warfare\u201d not to use chemical weapons. Yes, the President made a poignant case on national television and radio Wednesday night about the horrors of poison gas. But to my mind he didn\u2019t manage to make a sensible case for how this is qualitatively worse than the horrors of conventional warfare that has killed over 100 times as many Syrians. And to my mind he didn\u2019t make a convincing case as to how adding American attacks to the mix would increase the likelihood of peace or even how it would decrease the likelihood of Assad using chemical weapons if in fact we\u2019re NOT looking to oust Assad altogether and we\u2019re not attempting to destroy the chemical weapons themselves \u2013 for we know that any such attempt would simply release them into the air and cause the very harms we\u2019re trying to prevent.\nI\u2019m very thankful that there is now a reasonable possibility that the current impasse over chemical weapons and red lines will be resolved without sending American bombs into the midst of the Syrian Civil War. The Russians have given us a diplomatic way out. I\u2019m sure that President Putin\u2019s motives include a general desire to increase Russian influence in the World in general and the Middle East in particular. But, however Machiavellian his motives may be, my gut sense is that --- yes \u2013 he, with his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are very much serving the cause of peace.\nAnd I give a lot of credit to both President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry for switching course to give the diplomatic effort the best possible shot at success.\nOf course, a number of pundits have suggested that this course change suits President Obama just fine. The resolution of support he was seeking in Congress was poised to fail, and there is that suspicion all around that he was backed into a corner by his own red lines.\nWhatever the motivations, and whether all this was planned or serendipitous -- Let us hope and pray for the success of these diplomatic efforts.\nAnd further, let us hope and pray for the welfare of all of the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.\nMeanwhile, there are various organizations working to assist Syrian refugees. Many of us just a few months ago attended a fundraising dinner organized by the Islamic Center of the Twin Ports and the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Duluth for Syrian refugee relief.\nBetter than bombs, we can still contribute to such organizations as: CARE, Unicef, Doctors Without Borders or other groups that are trying to address what the World Health Organization has called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. I hope you will consider doing so as I have personally done earlier this week.\nJust remember that even if Syria signs on to the international convention of chemical weapons, and even if those weapons are put under international control and destroyed --- that doesn\u2019t mean that the Syrian crisis will have been resolved. Far from it.\nPsalm 34, one of the biblical passages that we often include in our Shabbat morning service charges us:\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05bc\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1 \u05e9\u05c1\u05b8\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd \u05d5\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05e4\u05b5\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc. \u2013 Seek peace and chase after it. May those who are pursuing peace be crowned with success in their efforts.\nAnd, in the meantime, amidst all the work that needs to be done in our own city, our own state, and our own country, may we nevertheless not stand idly by as the crisis that engulfs Syria continues to unfold.\nGmar chatimah tovah v\u2019tzom kal/ I wish you all a good sealing in the Book of Life, and an easy fast.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T13:04:07Z", "url": "http://www.jewishduluth.org/rabbi/2013/9/24/sermon-for-yom-kippur-evening-57742013.html", "byte_size": 14804, "char_size": 14606}

{"text": "It's not always easy to keep mentally focused during running. Focus requires discipline and a certain level of mental toughness, meaning that you have developed the capacity to perform to the best of your ability despite external conditions or internal distractions. You can minimize distractions and help yourself stay focused by implementing self-help techniques and maintaining a positive, nonjudgmental attitude.\nMentally tough athletes push through and overcome obstacles to stay focused on their ultimate goal. Developing the traits that characterize mental toughness can help you remain focused during running. According to sports psychologist JoAnn Dahlkoetter in an article for the online runner's resource, \"Competitor,\" several characteristics or traits tare commonly identified in mentally tough runners: Resilience, focus, strength, preparation, vision, openness and trust. You simply do not allow yourself to become distracted by external conditions or internal emotions -- you have the ability to put these distractions behind you for the time being and live in the moment.\nPositive self-talk can encourage you and help you stay focused while running. According to sports psychologists Leif Smith and Todd Kays in \"Sports Psychology for Dummies,\" mentally repeating specific cue words, such as \"focus\" or \"hustle,\" may help to increase your concentration when you feel a decrease in your level of focus. Tape the cue words to a piece of athletic tape around your wrist and mentally concentrate on them while you run, as though the words are your mantra. Don't beat yourself up if you're having an off day. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a good friend. Be positive and encouraging and tell yourself that you can do it.\nWhen you feel yourself starting to tire or slow down, marathon runner and trainer Jeff Galloway suggests practicing the following drill, adapted from his book, \"Mental Training for Runners: How to Stay Motivated.\" Tell yourself that you're going to continue running for just one minute more, reducing your pace slightly for a few seconds, then continue this pattern, telling yourself \"one more minute\" or \"10 more steps\" until you achieve your goal for the day. If you break down your goal into small chunks, it may seem more manageable and achievable and you'll be less likely to lose focus.\nAlmost all athletes use some form of visualization prior to or during their workout or competition to help them stay focused. According to Galloway, worrying and focusing on the negative possibilities is a major way that many runners become distracted and lose motivation. Visualization can help you overcome your worries and direct your focus back to your goal. Visualization involves vividly imagining and rehearsing positive outcomes to future events or the event in which you're currently involved. Before your race, you might lie down and imagine yourself running effortlessly, overcoming obstacles and achieving your goal. The more vividly you can imagine the scene by involving all of your five senses, the more effective your visualization will be.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T10:42:26Z", "url": "https://healthyliving.azcentral.com/keep-mentally-focused-during-running-2563.html", "byte_size": 3089, "char_size": 3089}

Practice that is 5 000 years old, cannot not work.\nWhat approach does Golden Dragon use in teaching martial arts?\nUnfortunately, the traditional Chinese approach to training in the modern world does not work.

These are unfortunately completely different things and in today\u2019s society most of the people exercise the second option. The approach to study of martial arts should include a detailed explanation of the basic principles of life. Despite the seemingly high level of education of a modern man, he can quickly understand and realize only the very basic things, so you must give the person an opportunity to feel the simple movement of his body and give him the opportunity to understand how these movement spread to the rest of his life. After all, it is no secret that the human mind and body are closely intertwined.

{"text": "Although preliminary and capable of being screwed up in winery, although we hope with our experience there is little of that, I think we can consider this vintage a great vintage, at least based on our cellar. There are two or three average lots, but the remainder have the potential to constitute one of the best four or five vintages I\u2019ve seen. All wines have exceptional acids and pHs, good for ageability and presaging a longer than normal immaturity in bottle before showing their stuff. This could be minimized by intense, overt fruit. All of this smacks of 1999 and 2008 vintages, especially in Pinot noirs. The Pinot noirs have enjoyed very long cold soaks, with up to 12-13 days and colors pulled that are reminiscent of finished wine in a very good vintage, even before fermentation heat!\nIn discussions with other wineries, if botrytis is excluded from the equation for others, they see the same thing. Botrytis in the valley differed somewhat based on location and viticultural practices. This difference should be the only factor for vintage variability. Thank you, Chad, for pristine vineyards in 2011.\nThis has been a condensed, late, hard-worked vintage. Harvest crews in vineyard can breathe a sigh of relief. In the winery it is another 10 days or more before it\u2019s a wrap.\nIt will all be worth it.\nA mixture of sun, fog, a little light rain, sun, and fog over the last week has accented the Riesling end of harvest in a beautiful and appropriate way. Hardy and with us encouraging a little botrytis in Riesling, we enjoy the final flourish at our four sites. Riesling fruit coming in is bright with high acids, lower sugars in the 18-20+ brix range, and with good flavors \u2014 Riesling has two aromatic/flavor peaks, one at 18-18.5 brix and another at 21+ brix.\nExcept for outside red pressings and barreling down, we now can disregard the four or five weather forecasts we all have bookmarked and watch winter fronts come in with a cup of coffee and a smile.\n2019 | Happy B Corp Month!", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T18:19:07Z", "url": "https://www.chehalemwines.com/2011/11/an-unusual-and-yet-excellent-vintage-2/", "byte_size": 2007, "char_size": 2001}

{"text": "I never got a chance to fly with Larry Newby, RedTail Aviation Chief Pilot at Canyonlands Field (CNY) near Moab, Utah. I bumped into him several times in my twice-a-year visits and flew with one of his mentors, LaVar Wells, a few times. Over the past five years, I have become familiar with the Utah backcountry near Canyonlands, Larry's home turf. By reputation from people I know and trust, Larry was the consummate back-country pilot with skill and judgment the rest of us could look up to. I enjoyed our conversations and learned from them. He communicated a love of flying and the local geology.\nOn 2012 April 25, Larry and two Texas guests, a father and son pair, Wade and Kyle Richardson, were flying a Cessna 185 that crashed in the Dark Canyon area south of Moab and east of Hite at the north end of Lake Powell. Speculation they were near the Dark Canyon Plateau airstrip gave way to reports they were further south in one of the canyons. It was a gusty Wednesday in southeast Utah, not an easy day for back-country flying, but a day that seemed well within the skills of an expert pilot. While we don't know exactly what happened, I don't think Larry was trying to land anywhere. Maybe he was caught in a canyon wind shear without enough altitude or airspeed to keep away from the rocks.\nIf there's a lesson here, then it's not that we should be better, smarter, or more-careful pilots than Larry Newby. If there are any pilots better, smarter, or more-careful than Larry, then they still aren't better, smarter, or more-careful enough to prevent what happened. The important message is that aviation is humbling sometimes and that any of us can get caught with our pants down by wind, weather, mechanical issues, or general bad luck. We have to make judicious choices of how much scenery we want to see and how much we want to do within the envelope of risk we accept. It can happen to any of us, anytime, anywhere, and we all have to be careful and diligent. Larry died doing what he loved, sharing the breathtaking beauty of the southeast-Utah backcountry with eager guests.\n20:58:45 Mountain Standard Time (MST).\n4219 visits to this web page.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T03:58:45Z", "url": "http://the-adam.com/adam/weblog/larrynewby.html", "byte_size": 2157, "char_size": 2157}

{"text": "I recently joined Health 2.0 and was brought on to play matchmaker as part of the company\u2019s rapidly expanding Matchpoint program. The idea of Matchpoint speaks to the traditional role of a matchmaker, which is to find parties that are compatible and show promise of true partnership. Interested parties \u2015 from small health tech startups to our large sponsors such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Medtronic, and UnitedHealthcare \u2015 all want the same thing. Each participant is seeking avenues for collaboration and the opportunity to partake in a journey that could lead to something meaningful.\nMatchpoint is an exclusive opportunity for health technology entrepreneurs and large organizations, payors, and investors to meet in focused one-on-one meetings to explore potential avenues for collaboration. Every 15 minutes, we set up 10 innovators and promising companies to meet, greet, and charm health industry leaders. Out of the 300 companies we evaluated, 40 were hand-selected based on their potential and interest from the host companies.\nHealth 2.0\u2019s preparation came to a head on Oct.10, and it heralded with it such excitement around the opportunities for both entrepreneurs and our large industry partners. After much preparation and event planning, it was just plain inspiring to see the excitement that filled the meeting rooms. Gangadhar Sulkunte from 4th Main Health flew in from France, thrilled to demo and present his company\u2019s work to large players like Aetna and Premera Blue Cross. Bart Foster, CEO of SoloHealth, had a line of meetings, which included face time with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Kaiser Permanente.\nSince its inception last year, Matchpoint has evolved from just providing focused platforms to incorporating workshops for entrepreneurs, setting up roundtables with industry leaders, and creating networking opportunities. Executive in Residence at Interwest Partners Michelle Synder discussed her \u201clessons learned\u201d with a focus on go to market strategies and an insider\u2019s perspective on what VCs are really looking for. Michelle was an early member of the senior executive team at Epocrates where she led user acquisition and monetization activities over an 11-year period from launch to IPO.\nFormer CTO of IDEO Doug Solomon provided his insight into how to leverage technologies that create social value and engage communities. Sanjaya Kumar, a veteran entrepreneur, spoke about how to navigate and gain traction in hospital markets. He directly spoke about his experience in leveraging a product that is now being used in nearly 2,500 hospitals. Lew Altman, a healthcare technology entrepreneur and strategist, gave an in-depth talk about how to succeed in payor-driven markets while building a business that adjusts to changing payment models.\nOur group invested a lot of time reading through company profiles and worked with our host partners to select emerging health technology companies to meet with. What struck me about Matchpoint was that our group had focused on selecting applicable companies and relevant partners so that these meetings maximized opportunity for collaboration. Matchpoint prevents both startups and potential collaborators or investors from sitting through demos that are not relevant to their areas of need.\nAt the day\u2019s end at our cocktail reception, both entrepreneurs and host companies expressed how thankful they were that the meetings were focused, and they said how refreshing it was to hear about a product that every person was invested in.\nThese up close and personal meetings allowed innovators to pilot, collaborate, and partner with companies that had an initial vested interest in their product. Could people like Gangadhar end up with a lasting partnership with a host company he met with? It was inspiring to see him so thrilled at the end of the day. Beyond networking or demoing at a conference, these meetings provided a platform for which a team had already taken a look at the technology, and deeper discussion was needed to explore avenues for further partnership.\nA few entrepreneurs came up to our team after our session and told us with the brightest eyes that a host partner arranged for follow-up talks. As for some of the smaller startups, both their relief that someone had recognized their efforts, and their optimism about what the future might hold was palpable. I was honored to take part in their excitement.\nMatchpoint really isn\u2019t just about the meetings and the workshops. At the heart of the event are the partnerships that extend beyond that day. These meetings represented useful and relevant avenues to contribute to health technology in a very meaningful way. It\u2019s a platform that both identifies and makes matches that are meant to be. It\u2019s about time to spread the love for health technology. We have our eyes set on various meetings both in the U.S. and internationally. Let\u2019s get together!\nJoy Bhosai, MPH, is Matchpoint manager at Health 2.0 and is a med student at UCSF.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T22:10:01Z", "url": "http://legacy.health2con.com/news/2012/12/17/matchmaking-the-health-2-0-way-2/", "byte_size": 5000, "char_size": 4974}

From out of the past come the thundering hoof beats of the great horse Silver!

What did kemo sabe mean? \u2013 boss, or pal, or champion of justice, or paleface idiot?\nWhen I was little, there was no radio in our house; our parents were deaf. Our grandparents had a big table-model Philco in their parlor. Just as kids nowadays tease for an iPhone, I kept asking for a radio until I got it. A tiny, dark-brown Bakelite-cased Arvin, it sat on the sideboard in our dining room.\nEvery weekday, from 4:45 till 6:00 in the afternoon, I pulled my long-legged chair up to the sideboard, turned on the radio, and gazed at the dial. Many of you must remember \"watching the radio\" and memorizing the numbers of the AM dial, from 520 to 1610 kilohertz. I could tell from the glances I got from my parents as I sat there \u2013 sitting still for longer than at any other time in my life \u2013 that they suspected I was listening to something inappropriate and possibly sinful.\nAt 4:45 a voice crackled over a simulated radio transmission: \"CX4 to control tower. CX4 to control tower. Standing by\u2026\" The answer was immediate: \"Control tower to CX4. Wind southeast, ceiling 1200. All clear.\"\n\"This is Hop Harrigan, coming in!\" So it went: five 15-minute episodes, featuring Jack Armstrong, Captain Midnight; Terry and the Pirates, and finally Tom Mix.\nEvenings, there were half-hour shows \u2013 The Green Hornet; The Shadow, in real life Lamont Cranston, \"wealthy young man-about-town\" who once in the Orient had learned to \"cloud men\u2019s minds so they cannot see him.\"\nEverything we imagined was the product of our separate minds\u2019 eyes.

{"text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Fighting in the Shiite stronghold of Sadr City killed 23 Iraqis yesterday, hospital officials said, and the U.S. military reported five troop deaths, as April showed signs of becoming the worst month for U.S. forces in Iraq since September.\nAt least 11 of the Iraqi deaths occurred when mortar shells landed in residential neighborhoods. Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic. In some parts of Sadr City, masked militiamen bearing machine guns and grenade launchers remained on the streets.\nOfficials at local hospitals have put the death toll in the neighborhood at more than 70 since Sunday, but it was not clear if those figures included militia fighters.\nThousands of Sadr City residents have fled for other neighborhoods. Prices in local markets were soaring as supplies dwindled, a result of suppliers' inability to bring in goods. Iraqi and U.S. forces appeared to be penetrating deeper into the neighborhood, one local journalist said.\nThere were no signs that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was pulling back on his offensive against Shiite militias, which has sparked fighting between Iraqi and U.S. forces and militiamen loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Al-Maliki's deadline for fighters to hand in heavy weapons expired Tuesday, but the latest clashes showed that rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and rockets remained in militia hands.\nBaghdad had spent part of yesterday quieter than in recent days, because of a curfew imposed to prevent clashes and protests marking the anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003.\nAl-Sadr had called for a huge march in Baghdad to mark the anniversary of Hussein's ouster and to protest the U.S. presence and al-Maliki's offensive. The cleric says the offensive, which began March 25 in the southern city of Basra, is targeting his Mahdi Army and is a ploy to cripple his political movement in advance of provincial elections planned for October.\nHis fighters have risen up against Iraqi and U.S. forces, virtually collapsing a cease-fire that al-Sadr announced last August and that was credited with bringing a sharp drop in violence nationwide.\nAlthough U.S. and Iraqi officials maintain that they are targeting criminal elements or \"special groups\" that did not abide by al-Sadr's truce, U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker acknowledged yesterday that the Basra offensive had drawn in others.\n\"A dangerous development in the immediate wake of the Basra operation was what appeared to be a reunification between special groups and JAM,\" he told lawmakers in Washington, using the acronym for al-Sadr's militia.\nCrocker and Gen. David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, gave lawmakers their assessments of the war during two days of hearings in Washington that ended yesterday.\nThe surge in troop deaths since the Basra offensive has underscored their contention that security gains witnessed in recent months easily could be reversed. At least 30 U.S. troops have died in Iraq since the Basra operation began, most in Baghdad; at least 19 have died in Iraq so far this month, representing the highest daily average since last September.\nThe deaths announced yesterday brought to at least 4,031 the number of U.S. troops to die in Iraq since the war began in March 2003. Brief military statements said three of the soldiers died in roadside bomb blasts: two in northeastern Baghdad and one east of the city. Two others died of \"non-combat\" injuries, statements said, giving no other details.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T15:06:36Z", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2008-04-10-0804100267-story.html", "byte_size": 3582, "char_size": 3582}

The drill hole ended with 3 to 4 times background levels of zinc (> 60 ppm) in highly altered limestone.\nSeveral geological factors make the fault zone a prospective target for zinc-lead-silver mineralization. Firstly, the entire fault zone was active during the formation of the Waulsortian limestone.

{"text": "As an aesthetic and social phenomenon of the modern age, of all other fine arts, the poster reflects most accurately, clearly and acutely the political and social climate of its time. Most often anonymous, genuinely street born, the Poster is the fastest to reach its viewers. It should hit with its calling power, it should be a slogan, a sign, a spell and a symbol. It has to be convincing and persuasive.\nThe history of the 20th century Bulgarian political poster has its ups and downs. It becomes a flag of the left-wing forces between the two world wars, proclaiming the new social ideas of time. In the years immediately after September 9, 1944 artists without special training in the field of poster art \u2013 graphics and painters, pave the way for the Bulgarian poster, search and find its essence, specifics and means of expression. During the Cult of Stalin Bulgarian poster becomes a substitute of its own, obeying the lowly criteria and directives of the regulatory aesthetics. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, several generations of professionally-trained poster artists bring poster art to its contemporary level of achievements, and the variety of their plastic visions determines the character of the Bulgarian poster school.\nThe New Political Poster exhibition is a joint project of the Museum of Socialist Art and the National Academy of Art. It offers an alternative point of view, a new focus on the thematic issues of the museum institution. Furthermore, it is an opportunity for expression of the younger generation of Bulgarian poster artists.\nI am sure that in solving their academic tasks, students have faced all the challenges of the most complex and specific genre variety of the poster \u2013 the political theme. Today poster art is free from the ideological pressure of the past, from political and aesthetic \u201cconsiderations\u201d, from the dictum of the investor in the face of a party and a state. Now the question is what will be the new face of the Bulgarian political poster and what will be its public resonance. I think that the New Political Poster exhibition is relevant both to the issues it is examining and to the dialogue between the Museum and its audience. Here I see a chance to assess the ability of artistic and public awareness, responsiveness, understanding and attitude towards the social problems of today.\nThe reason for organizing this event is the comment of the journalist Stefan Djambazov from \u0412\u044a\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0438.com about the very few political and social posters in our exhibition on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Specialty in Bankya Art Center.\nNaturally, I did not quite agree with that statement, and referred to the genre variety sought in the selection. I also made it clear that our students have a specific learning task in their curriculum \u2013 the political poster.\nSoon after that, in a purposefully made conversation with the artist Nikolay Ushtavaliiski, I shared mine and my students' intention to visit the Museum of Socialist Art, whose curator is he. Nikolay suggested that it would be a good idea if our visit to the Museum was followed by a poster exhibition. The museum we have not reached yet, but bringing the two comments together is how the idea for this event was born. The students received urgent tasks, so the majority of the posters in this exhibition were made in the last two months and added to the work of the past few years. Together with our colleagues from the Department we selected this exposition, and Prof. Georgi Iankov proposed the name New Political Poster.\nThis year our Specialty has had good cooperation with many organizations and cities, including the 70-year-old Dimitrovgrad. Today we celebrate another initiative with the 70th anniversary of the National Gallery. We are grateful for the invitation and the opportunity to show some of the works of our smart and talented students. Our hope is to present here the new face of the Bulgarian political poster, especially because we are among those who remember the old one. Let us hope that our students, having, for their own benefit, faced a past that is distant for them, will enjoy greater freedom to think about the present and the future.\nPoster and Visual Communication Dept.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T19:06:37Z", "url": "http://academyposter.com/en/news/the-new-political-poster", "byte_size": 4241, "char_size": 4224}

In distributed regression, a typical approach is to divide the big data into multiple blocks, apply a base regression algorithm on each of them, and then simply average the output functions learnt from these blocks. Since the average process will decrease the variance, not the bias, bias correction is expected to improve the learning performance if the base regression algorithm is a biased one. Regularization kernel network is an effective and widely used method for nonlinear regression analysis. In this paper we will investigate a bias corrected version of regularization kernel network. We derive the error bounds when it is applied to a single data set and when it is applied as a base algorithm in distributed regression. We show that, under certain appropriate conditions, the optimal learning rates can be reached in both situations.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T01:46:38Z", "url": "http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v18/17-423.html", "byte_size": 963, "char_size": 961}
{"text": "The Philippines of recent years has witnessed a spectacular turnaround. Over the past decade, the country has averaged 5% GDP growth each year. Sound economic fundamentals - such as declining debt and low inflation - and a workforce that is young, diverse, educated and English-speaking has made the Philippines a rising star poised to seize the opportunities of the global economy.\nThe new administration, elected in May, has professed its commitment to the further liberalization of trade through free trade agreements. Its eagerness to join the mega-regional TPP is palpable. \"The new government is one that will keep the policy of maximizing foreign trade agreements participation,\u201d Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said in August.\nWhen the ASEAN Economic Community was established last year, the Philippines also joined nine other nations to form an enormous market of $2.6 trillion and 622 million people. Together, they are the third largest economy in Asia and the seventh largest in the world.\nThe United States is the Philippines\u2019 third largest trading partner, and gives the Philippines preferential duty-free access to U.S. markets under the Generalized System of Preferences. $16.5 billion worth of goods was exchanged between the two countries in 2015. Looking forward, we can expect the United States and the Philippines to continue its tradition of robust trade.\nFilipino exports are driven by the manufacturing sector. A labor force that is hardworking and highly educated gives the country a competitive edge in manufacturing. If you take a look at the top 10 exports from the Philippines in 2015 - which accounted for 83.5% of exports - eight are manufactured goods.\nFrom wood products to transport equipment, manufactured goods of all shapes and sizes come out of the Philippines. By far, the hottest manufacturing export is electronics - and that subsector is dominated by semiconductors. Electronics was easily the biggest export in all five of the largest destination markets for Filipino goods: Japan, U.S., China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. We should also mention that the Philippines is one of the top seafood exporting countries in the world, particularly tuna. Even so, the Philippines is far from producing seafood at its highest capacity given its long coastline and inland bodies of water, which means that there is plenty of untapped potential for this export in the future.\nThe growth of imports into the Philippines since the beginning of 2016 is fueled by increases in consumer demand, capital goods, and new construction. In spite of the downturn in the global economy, consumer confidence is high in the Philippines. Consumer goods, which comprise 17.9% of imports, increased 47.2% year-over-year in May. Consumer spending in the Philippines has buoyed the economy, rising from 63% of GDP a decade ago to three-quarters today. This phenomenon is underpinned in part by remittances from 2.3 million strong Filipinos who work abroad and further propelled by the explosion of foreign tourists \u2013 many from China - spending money while traveling in the Philippines. The country\u2019s young population will be a driving force for domestic demand in future years as well.\nFavorable demographics will continue to help the Philippines become a destination for manufacturing. As exports grow and the spending power of Filipinos rise, imports will continue on an upward trajectory \u2013 both because of consumer demand and the need to bring in raw materials for processing. The Philippines was once called \u201cthe sick man of Asia\u201d because of poor economic policies that kept the country from taking off. Today, it\u2019s well on its way to resuming its coveted position as a hotspot in global trade.\nTo meet the growing demand for international and domestic freight forwarding in the Philippines, AGWorld has opened a Manila office. We will focus on air and ocean freight (import and export), customs, and domestic trucking services. Our Manila outpost will also offer value added services that many local forwarders lack, including tracking capabilities that give our customers visibility into shipments at all times. AGWorld staff in the Philippines boast 50+ years of experience in the logistics industry.

{"text": "Constructing Excellence in Wales :: ICM: Just how integrated are you?\nHome > Latest News > ICM: Just how integrated are you?\nICM: Just how integrated are you?\nTraditional management approaches tend to artificially separate land management from water management which often result in unsustainable practices that can ultimately lead to water pollution, increased flood risk to communities and ecosystems degradation. In addition, traditional flood risk management approaches are centred on structural flood defences such as floodwalls, which are restricted by high capital, maintenance and upgrade costs, and cannot be raised indefinitely in response to increasing flood risk.\nICM focuses both on reducing flood risk and on delivering wider benefits such as water quality improvements and other ecosystem services. By viewing the river catchment as a system, ICM results in more sustainable ways of managing runoff. This catchment-wide approach is commonly based around measures that enhance, restore or mimic natural processes, referred to as Natural Flood Management (NFM). There are several NFM techniques available and these can bring multiple benefits at catchment level including flood protection, erosion reduction, enhanced water quality, carbon storage and biodiversity.\nArup and its partners recently developed and delivered an ICM training course for professionals through the Built Environment Sustainability Training (BEST) programme in Wales. The course is now available to any group or organisation working in the water environment.

As such, we have been looking at academic and non-academic factors which are linked to poor performance and optimal performance.\nIf we can find factors which are linked to poor performance, we can address these early in future years to ensure better performance. If we can find factors which are linked to optimal performance, we can encourage and nurture these factors through the year to help students achieve the best results.\nThe first study examined the Influence of year-on-year performance on final degree classification in a chiropractic master\u2019s degree program. This involved an analysis of student\u2019s assessment grades over their period of study at the AECC to see if performance in one year can predict performance in another year or whether it is possible to predict degree classification based on previous assessment results.\nCurrently, the team are analysing non-academic factors, such as attendance, previous education, library usage, additional learning needs (ALN), time management, study skills and stress, and whether these can help identify which students are at risk of failing.\nFuture work in this area is ongoing both within the AECC and through collaborations with other universities such as the Welsh Institute of Chiropractic, to build a bigger picture of the type of student who may need additional assistance in their education so that they can be appropriately supported to achieve their full potential.\nResults of these studies have been presented at international conferences, such as the World Federation of Chiropractic Conference in Washington D.C. and the European Chiropractors\u2019 Union Conferences in Dublin and Cyprus.

This can put their security at risk, as the easiest way a burglar can enter a house is by finding the spare key. An ideal gift for those who forget their house keys is a Key Safe. There is an assortment of Key Safe\u2019s available in a variety of sizes, makes and models. Most Key Safe\u2019s can only be accessed by a code which only the owner and their loved ones know. They are extremely durable and weather resistant, and can be found on the Keytek shop!\nMotorcycle and bicycle theft remains a growing problem and can be easily avoided by the use of a bike and motorbike lock. If a loved one has a passion for biking, a gift that secures their most prized possession is ideal for Christmas, as motorcycles and cycles can be very expensive, therefore targeted by thieves. Keytek Shop stocks various locks, from chain locks to loop locks, which all offer high levels of security for bikes and motorcycles.\nWhy not consider a humorous yet practical gift this Christmas. The range of Decoy Safe\u2019s on the Keytek Shop can be used to hide money, jewellery and valuables in plain sight. The Keytek Shop offers 3 models of Decoy Safe\u2019s; The Heinz Baked Beanz, Heinz Spaghetti and Heinz Tomato Soup cans, all recognised by the police, neighbourhood watch groups and insurance companies as effective theft deterrents.\nThis year don\u2019t just resort to your usual go to gifts for Christmas; why not throw in a practical gift as well!

This is because the documentation does not address the client\u2019s specific configuration, processes and use of the application.\nMosaic Consulting addresses this need by designing materials that speak to the specific workflows and procedures addressed in the development phase of your project.\nThe result is documentation that you can use to train new staff and that will serve as a reference to answer specific questions existing users might have as they continue enhancing their knowledge of your matter management program, workflows and technology.\nMosaic's IT team is all you will need to seamlessly integrate your matter management system with other legal and non-legal applications. Mosaic will identify the information your other applications need to receive; map the data; design and program the interface; and work with the required vendor to test and implement the new interface.\nMosaic has the skills and depth of knowledge to make your matter management initiatives exceed expectations.\nThe professionals at Mosaic are experts in matter management. And we provide a full suite of enterprise legal management services that will complement your matter management initiatives and round-out your legal operations program.\nMosaic's expertise in designing and delivering training will help your team maximize the benefits of the systems and processes you put in place.

Head over to Van Loveren Family Vineyards in the picturesque Robertson Valley on 13 October for the Java MTB Challenge to enjoy a fun-filled sporting day for the entire family and breath-taking vineyard views, all while supporting a very worthy cause.\nThe event has built up a loyal following over the years and regulars at the Java MTB Challenge use the race to train for the upcoming Wines2Whales and To Hell and Back. Apart from thrilling MTB and trail running across scenic farmland and mountains, the Java MTB Challenge also offers enticing food stalls, good music, wine tasting, lucky draws, prizes to the value of R40,000.00 and a great vibe!\nRoutes range from a non-technical fun ride which is perfect for families to do together all the way up to gruelling routes for top riders only. For safety reasons, no kids under 16 years will be allowed on the 45km and 80km tracks. All participants will be rewarded with medals and goodie-bags upon crossing that finish line.\nThe 6km MTB route is an easy, non-technical fun ride suitable for small children (parents welcome to ride with).\nThe 20km route is ideal for beginners. It consists mostly of jeep tracks with some single tracks, and is not very technical, with only 250m elevation. Take note that no children under 10 years will be allowed the 20 km track and kids younger than 12 years must be accompanied by an adult rider.\nThe 45km route is suitable for intermediate riders with an elevation of about 850m.\nThe 80km is a gruelling route for the adrenalin seekers. It includes many sections of the 2018 ABSA Cape Epic route as well as virgin territory and custom-built single tracks. The 1600m elevation will thrill even the most seasoned rider.\nRunners can look forward to a 10km vineyard trail run over rugged terrain and crossing the confluence of two rivers. The 276m elevation and rocky terrain will be an exciting challenge for novice and experienced runners alike.\nMTB entrants are reminded to bring and wear their PPA MTB timing boards. R25 can be added for a permanent timing board for participants who do not already have one. PPA members receive their first MTB timing board for free. Replacement boards are R50. The trail run is a self-timed event, so no PPA timing board is required.\nThe Java MTB Challenge is a fundraising platform for local schools and charitable organisations and has raised over R500,000.00 in cash for its local community to date.\nRobertson Primary School, Robertson Preparatory School, Wakkerstroom-Wes Rural School, Jakes Gerwel Educational Trust School, Herberg Children\u2019s Home, Bonnievale Vrybrugers.\nThe main sponsors of the day are Van Loveren and Pick n Pay (Robertson), with additional sponsorships from Monsanto, M\u00f4reson Grondverskuiwers, Ford Rola Motor Group, Lelienfontein Vine Growers and Tekco Packaging.\nright (GPS Coordinates: S33 \u030a52\u201931.3\u201d E 020 \u030a 0\u2019 9.1\u201d).\n@vl_java_mtb (Facebook) and @vl_java_mtb (Instagram).", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T16:01:33Z", "url": "https://bikebay.co.za/blogs/press-release/be-a-part-of-the-robertson-valley-s-biggest-adrenalin-rush-the-java-mtb-challenge", "byte_size": 3035, "char_size": 3020}

Everything on the car is chosen by the customer.\nThis vehicle is a 100 percent, pure Danish vehicle. Everything from design to manufacture is done in Denmark. Customers can go through only one dealer in the United States to get this car, which has a price tag of $1.8 million. Empirio Motor Group of New York City will fly buyers to the Zenvo factory in Denmark. Here, customers will choose every option from interior styling to color and wheels. The vehicle is then constructed to the exact specifications of the customer and then brought back to the US via plane. To date, there are only three of these vehicles in the country, and only 15 of these models is expected to be manufactured.\nThe ST-1 has a 16-valve, 8 cylinder engine coupled with a six-speed manual transmission powered to the rear wheels. This sleek vehicle will get you from 0 to 60mph in only 2.9 seconds. That\u2019s roughly 1,100 horses galloping through your veins!\nIn keeping with the racing appearance of the vehicle, the tires are 19 inches in the front and 20 inches in the rear. This vehicle weighs 1376kg, or just over 3033 pounds. You only get 105mm of ground clearance with the Zenvo ST-1, so it\u2019s best not to take out on bumpy roads. Of course, the double wishbone suspension will help absorb and variations in the road.\nInside the vehicle you will find nothing short of what you would expect for almost 2 million dollars. Airbags, check. Cruise control, check. Electronic analog instrument panel, check. Leather everything, check. G-force meter, check. What more could you possibly want? A theft system?

While there has been abundant scholarship on medieval Christian and Jewish preaching, Linda G. Jones's book is the first to consider the significance of the tradition of pulpit oratory in the medieval Islamic world. Traversing Iberia and North Africa from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries, the book analyses the power of oratory, the ritual juridical and rhetorical features of pre-modern sermons and the social profiles of the preachers and orators who delivered them.

Therefore we want to assure you that any information you choose to share with us on our site will not be sold or shared with additional parties without your express permission.\nHow much is your local sales tax?\nThere is no sales tax in the state of Oregon so there will not be sales tax added to your order.\nAinslee\u2019s Homemade Salt Water Taffy is carefully packaged to ensure a secure arrival but please note that it is not recommended to ship our fudge into warm climates as it may melt in the package.\nPlease be sure to check delivery addresses carefully. We cannot extend our guarantee to orders for which we are given incomplete or incorrect addresses. Postal and delivery services will not forward the packages on without the correct address.\nPlease allow 2-3 days to process and ship orders. We will make every effort to expedite orders. We ship orders via USPS priority unless otherwise specified in your order form. See more on our shipping and handling page.\nHow can I recommend you to my friends and family?\nAs a family owned business we rely on word of mouth advertising to increase our sales so that we are able to provide you with the freshest possible product for the most reasonable price we can offer. As you can imagine, the busier we are, the more reasonably priced candies we can offer to you so please spread the word and help us stay around for yet another generation of quality candy making. You can also fill out the \"Recommend Us\" form on our website.\nWhat kind of ingredients do you use? How will I know if something is contained within the product?\nWherever we can we make sure to use all natural ingredients in our products. This means no artificial preservatives to lengthen the shelf life of your candy and therefore a more natural product for your body.\nAlthough we employ careful sanitation procedures in our cooking process it is important that you know that there is a chance of allergens being introduced into your product so please be cautious if you have a severe allergy. For example we make the peanut butter filled taffy on the same machine as all the rest of the taffy and there is no way to ensure that we have safely eliminated 100% of the peanut contamination before starting the next batch. If you have a specific allergy concern please feel free to email us with questions.\nWhat is the best way to store my taffy?\nWhat is the best way to store my Caramel Corn?\nThe enemy to freshness here is air and heat. We ship it in a plastic bag to ensure the least amount of air gets to the product. If you would like to keep it longer than a week (after you receive it) you will want to get as much air out of the bag as possible and store it either in Tupperware, or a ziplock bag for maximum freshness.\nWhat is the best way to store my Fudge?\nFudge will stay fresh for approximately ten days if properly wrapped in plastic wrap or Tupperware. Refrigerating your fudge will dry it out so try to keep it at room temperature. If you would like to keep your fudge for longer than ten days you will need to properly protect it by wrapping it in plastic wrap and then slipping it into a freezer safe bag to store in the freezer. It will keep well in the freezer for up to three months.\nDo you partner for fundraising?\nActually we do. We have several different programs to help you raise money for your cause. Please email or contact our store for specific questions.\n15% Discount of homemade salt water taffy to all active duty military personnel with valid military id.

In order to receive the discount on a web orders please send your order by email or snail mail so that we may apply your discount to the final purchase price.\nWe do offer discounts on large orders but please be aware that we will need adequate notice to fulfill larger than typical orders. The timeframe necessary is dependant upon the size of the order.\nCan I get my candy customized? You used to have a certain flavor, can I still buy that flavor?\nIf you are willing to buy the entire batch we can customize the taffy color of virtually any of our flavors for you. We also have discontinued flavors that we can craft for you if you do not see them on our web site so please do not hesitate to ask. Additionally, sometimes we have recipes for things we do not carry (such as Amaretto fudge, licorice caramel corn or almond brittle) that we can make upon request but please keep in mind that there is a necessary minimum order, contact us to find out more.\nDo you have a taffy of the month program?\nYes, actually we send the recipient a different flavor of taffy every single month. You can choose a three, six month or year long program and either go with the default flavor of the month, mixed or create your own combination for each month.

{"text": "UPDATED! Scroll down to see who won!\nBefore I get into the review, the photos and the details, let me say we will have THREE winners for this amazing giveaway which includes a Springfield Girls doll, the Springfield Collection Storage Trunk for 18\u2033 dolls, outfits and accessories to fill it! WOW. Now on to the photos, my insight and how to enter (scroll to the bottom of the post to find out how to enter).\nLet\u2019s start by meeting the Springfield Collection. Maria, Olivia, Madison, Abby and Emma are a line of very affordable 18\u2033 vinyl play dolls that are similar to American Girl, Journey Girls, Madame Alexander and other lines. The Springfield Girls dolls can be purchased at Michaels craft stores nationwide, along with other stores like A.C. Moore and Joanns. The dolls run approximately $20 and if you use one of the retailers coupons you can get them even less expensive. Their accessories are adorable and make excellent stocking stuffers, gifts for friends, and birthday party favors.\nThe girls come dressed in simple meet dresses and they make a perfect friend for your other 18\u2033 dolls, are great as a starter doll for a young girl who is just getting into dolls or as a model for your sewing projects. Like American Girl dolls, they have vinyl faces and limbs and soft bodies. The Springfield Girls limbs are not strung like American Girl, rather they are sewn in. The girls have a hard time standing without shoes on, but once you dress them up and put shoes on their feet, they do great!\nIn this photo Abby and Madison are modeling some of the outfits we received for review. Abby is wearing the Plaid Tunic and Leggings outfit ($9.95) with a pair of Springfield Collection Crocs that we already had. Madison is so comfy in the Pajamas and Bunny slippers from the Pajamarama Set which includes two pair of jammies and slippers for $16.99. Madison is very happy to be here and immediately went to the library and picked out her favorite Cecile book and found the comfy chair I had made earlier this fall.\nThis is Maria (some packaging still says Sophia but her name has been changed) modeling the Pop Princess outfit from the gift set while standing in front of the Storage Trunk. The Storage Trunk is made of sturdy cardboard and features two hanging racks and two drawers to keep your doll\u2019s accessories neat and tidy.\nI have more photos of the Springfield Girls in action and will be posting them throughout the weekend, but I want to get this awesome giveaway started first!!

I am a professional personal trainer based in Danbury although I regularly travel to surrounding areas and so in this respect I am mobile and willing to train anywhere \u2013 I am prepared with all the fitness equipment we need and so I can bring the gym to you!\nI believe flexibility is key when it comes to satisfying client\u2019s needs. I will train outdoors, at your home or in the private gym facility that I have prepared should you wish.\nI am also able to be flexible in the type of training I can provide. All clients will have different needs and preferences and I consider it my responsibility to deliver to each individual a programme that they find engaging and stimulating. Some options can include circuit style sessions, kettlebell exercises, weight training, body weight exercises, vipr bar and medicine ball sessions\u2026.\nClients will have in mind different fitness targets and goals. Some people wish to tone, others want to build muscle whilst some want to make every day movements effortless and more efficient (core function), and this may also include correcting postural deviations. The ultimate aims of clients will differ enormously and so it is important for me to establish clear short, medium and long term targets. These targets act as markers on our fitness journey and help us to highlight our progress.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that with any gain (fitness or other wise) there can be a plateau in progress at some point. I consider it my role to support, encourage and assist clients through these spells and battle through to our next peak. I am a positive and enthusiastic person that believes in providing innovative and dynamic sessions. This enthusiasm coupled with a diligent and considered approach helps drive my clients to meet our fitness goals.\nIf you would like to meet for a complimentary consultation you can contact me via phone or email. I have a direct link established on the home page.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T10:07:18Z", "url": "https://www.activeanywhere.co.uk/about-us/", "byte_size": 1999, "char_size": 1991}
{"text": "Last year I sat down with the Bermudan Government and helped write the guide on how they should regulate their blockchain ecosystem.\nWe took the ideas and the discussions that the government had been working on for three years \u2013 and helped pass the regulatory and legislative frameworks into law with the government in just three months.\nIt was not the first. But, it was by far one of the fastest movements of ideation to regulation the industry has seen yet. It represents the growing trend of governments looking to use blockchain in new, and unprecedented ways. Ways that will undoubtedly affect you as an individual.\nThere\u2019s a lot of noise in the blockchain space. On a daily basis, we encounter countless proclamations of unbridled potential, and stories that drive market fear. But in contrast to the well-entrenched narrative against cryptocurrency, governments are actively educating and collaborating with the industry.\nThe idea? Embrace the underlying technology, balance interests, safeguard and standardize the framework around it.\nBermuda is one country that has rapidly moved forward. Mauritius is another that has looked to the Bermudan framework and said \u201cOK, we\u2019d like to implement that here too\u201d. Mauritius appears to be looking to provide more privacy and data services to companies coming into their borders, and across jurisdictions in the country.\nI\u2019d say that by the end of 2019, you should expect to see 13 to 15 countries with legislation on blockchain.\nUnderstanding this legislation, from a startup, established business or citizen perspective, is going to help you navigate the landscape when it comes to business, privacy and investing.\nWe can hop around the globe and find other examples of how governments are using blockchain to fuel services. We\u2019ll get to, what I believe, is one of the underlying misconceptions about governments and blockchain in the next paragraph.\nDubai has always been focused on the cutting edge. From it\u2019s man-made islands, the the tallest building in the world \u2013 they\u2019re constantly looking for ways to drive innovation. Blockchain technology is no exception.\nThe Dubai Department of Finance (DoF) recently partnered with the Smart Dubai Office (SDO) to launch a blockchain based payment system. It\u2019s already in use by the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority and the Knowledge and Human Development Authority \u2013 two large departments that have never really had cross-departmental interaction.\nOnce in place \u2013 citizens of Dubai could see notable improvements in service.\nAnd while it\u2019s older news, in 2016 the government of Georgia became the first to use the bitcoin blockchain to validate property-related transactions. Again in an effort to improve citizen services.\nGovernments have been, well, governing for a long long time. What I think is critical to note here though, is that while the application layer of \u201chere\u2019s what xyz government is doing\u201d is interesting, and there\u2019s often a misconception of \u201coh, they\u2019re just trying to stop innovation\u201d \u2013 the underlying motive is what\u2019s important.\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen \u2013 again working with the OECD, G7, G20 and others \u2013 is, the motivation, it\u2019s all around impact.\nBoth good and bad impact.\nThere\u2019s the recognition that our industry will have a massive impact on many areas of life. On tax policies, labour markets, privacy, monetary policies, education systems \u2013 and much much more.\nUnless we\u2019re careful, some of these impacts may be unfavorable.\nIf it seems like there\u2019s uncertainty from a government perspective \u2013 you\u2019d be right. There is. But this does not mean there\u2019s not an interest or a desire to embrace the technology. That is here as well.\nGovernments are moving forward faster than you might realize to try and ensure we all build the right regulatory environments and leverage the technology in a way that can best suit everyone\u2019s lives.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T01:59:54Z", "url": "https://irishtechnews.ie/impact-standardization-examples-of-how-blockchain-can-be-used-by-governments/", "byte_size": 3926, "char_size": 3856}

{"text": "The kitchen is the most emotionally bonding room in the home in 94512, Solano County in California. It serves to establish a bond with the first viewing of the home by prospective buyers. After the purchase, each visitor is ushered into the kitchen in California, preferably the home's owner does so with pride. He or she does this to initiate and solidify yet another bond with another person. If your kitchen fails to meet certain standards, it's almost impossible to form these essential bonds with others successfully. The state of your kitchen may be indicating that you desperately need Kitchen Remodeling in 94512, Solano County in California. aristaskitchen.com is a great place to get the inspiration and guidance needed to create the ideal functioning kitchen for your family and home.\nThe designer in 94512, Solano County in California begins working on conceptualizing a new look for your kitchen. When you agree on the new layout, a work contract will be presented for you to sign. The contract will include an estimate of the costs and will probably include floor plans as well as list the parties involved including the contractor, designer, planner and project manager. The contract may need to be revised and your signature may be required more than once for each change or addition.\nDesign ideas include the working triangle's configuration, the appliances selected, the look of your countertops and the look of your cabinets in CA. In addition, there are wall colors to choose and lighting elements along with your flooring choice. If you are a dedicated chef, you may require upscale appliances or a gas range versus an electric range. If you prefer automation, you may need a built-in microwave, toaster oven and or a dishwasher. Effective countertops can be granite, Carrara marble, quartz, Corian, Formica, butcher block or concrete. Cabinet choices are plentiful also. Owners can choose cabinets made from solid wood, composite, laminate or Thermofoil. The owner will pay $80-150 per linear foot for solid wood cabinets and $50-$75 per linear foot for laminate or Thermofoil cabinets. This particular kitchen element will probably be the most costly element of the kitchen remodel in 94512, Solano County in California.\nWorking along with the choices for appliances, kitchen elements such as cabinets, countertops and lighting are flooring and wall treatments. The designer and the homeowner will select the flooring material that serves their needs and taste best. Wall treatments are the most arbitrary of the design options, as wall colors rarely affect the performance of the kitchen in 94512, Solano County in California. Arista Kitchen will guide all your selections so that they combine to formulate the most successful final product, your remodeled kitchen.\nAristaKitchen is the number one source for all your Kitchen Remodeling needs in CA. All our designers and tradesmen are professional and licensed. We finish every remodeling job on time and on budget with the finesse desired by our patrons.

{"text": "As a video games industry veteran, Brenda Romero does not do false modesty. Instead of hiding her Bafta in the loo or using it as a doorstop, her British Academy of Film and Television Arts golden gong takes centre stage in the conference room of Romero Games, the firm she runs with her husband in Galway.\nThe prize is flanked by a vintage Remington typewriter, a repicla vintage speaker, and dozens of board games. The designer, artist and Fulbright scholar may be rightly proud of her achievement, but for Romero and her spouse \u2014 celebrated games director, designer, developer and programmer John Romero \u2014 their work is all about play.\nThis month, Romero was given the Bafta Games Awards\u2019 special prize for her lifelong contribution to the industry, her passion for training the next generation of game-makers, and her advocacy of an often derided medium as an art form. She has attended countless award ceremonies in her 36-year career, but there was something special about being recognised by her peers.\n\u201cWhen I got the email I checked to see if it was fake,\u201d she admits. \u201cThe only reason that I believed it was legit was because I had been to a previous Bafta event and recognised the font on the letter.\nRomero, who in additon to creating games is also director of the University of Limerick\u2019s MSc course in game design and development, has worked on 49 video games, including the Wizardry series and titles in the Def Jam, Ghost Recon and Dungeons and Dragons franchises.\nHer six-part physical board game series The Mechanic is the Message has won acclaim for its handling of sensitive subjects such as slavery and the Holocaust.\nRomero began working in games in 1981, aged 15. The role as a tester at Sir-tech Software was her dream job, playing games around the clock so she could memorise every level and pass on tips to callers via a hotline. Spurning highly paid jobs to remain in the industry, she graduated to product development, and writing and designing games.\nA passionate advocate of gaming as a boundary-pushing art form, Romero\u2019s work has blurred the lines between genres. Her Mechanic is the Message board game series \u2014 including The New World, about the slave trade; S\u00edoch\u00e1n Leat, a chronicle of Irish history which is exhibited in the National Museum of Play in New York; and Train, in which players load pawns into model carriages and transport them to concentration camps \u2014 challenges gamers to question their actions.\n\u201cEvery other art form can cover difficult topics, so why not games? Some of the best photographs you\u2019ll ever see have to deal with difficult subject matter \u2014 it\u2019s part of their power \u2014 but, for some reason, we got stuck with this idea that games have to be fun.\nRomero, whose great-grandfather William left Skibbereen as a stowaway aged 12, was given the chance to trace her roots when awarded a Fulbright scholarship in 2014. What began as a three-month road trip in Ireland became a permanent move.\nLast year, the Romeros teamed up with their 12-year-old son Donovan to make Gunman Taco Truck, a comedy action game. The title was such a success that it will fund Donovan\u2019s college fees.\nNot taking her lifetime achievement award too literally, she has no plans to hang up her joystick and instead is working on a secret project she says will fulfil a long-time ambition.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T10:39:50Z", "url": "https://dianewolkstein.com/games-guru-takes-fun-to-another-level/", "byte_size": 3353, "char_size": 3319}
{"text": "Abstract: Atmospheric water vapour is an important (natural) greenhouse gas, infuencing both directly and indirectly the global radiative balance of the Earth as well as heat and moisture fluxes at the surface. Since water vapour concentrations may change as a result of surface warming and other environmental/meteorological factors, there is a need to understand the long-term behaviour. Changes are small, so it is critical to use high quality data with well-defined uncertainties and biases, particularly for climate research. Hyper-spectral infrared (IR) sounders such as the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) allow for higher vertical resolution profile measurements of water vapour to be obtained compared to their predecessors. First results of global comparisons of AIRS profiles show that for tropospheric layers between 925-374 hPa biases are within +-10% and a significant dry bias of 20% in regions of the upper troposphere, consistent with recent comparisons to reanalysis.

{"text": "On another note, one of the upsides of moving is that you get to determine what you might actually need and what you might not need going forward. That\u2019s huge. Now the downside. As a prepper, you have a ton of stored clothes, boots, gloves, MOPPS gear, wheat, beans, rice, flour, etc, etc, etc. You get the picture. All of you you think you need, just in case\u2026 So, I looked it over, determined that some of the food could go, get donated, etc. I could replace it later, and I had enough long term storage to fill the gap if I needed it to. So that is where I am. But what was daunting was loading up buckets, buckets, and more buckets of food\u2026 I felt like it would never end. To boot, we\u2019ve moved from a place with a basement. You know, that cool dry place you\u2019re supposed to keep your food storage, to a home without a basement, but a crawl space. So all my food storage is in the warm humid garage at the moment, until I can figure out the next step, which may be a climate controlled storage unit. But that is not a perfect scenario either. I\u2019ll probably get an air conditioner for the garage and kill two birds with one stone, keep it cooler, and kill the humidity as well.\nThe other issue I have is organizing it all. I have a garage that is full of stuff still in boxes, and it really does need to be sorted out soon, as in the event of an actual emergency, I\u2019ll be wasting a lot of time doing things like digging out a propane heater or the generator that is currently buried. All of this takes time.\nBack to the move. I had originally planned on moving all my preps myself. I wanted a higher level of OPSEC. Reality kicked in though with some business travel and barely enough time to pack, so the preps got moved with everything else. That said, many preps were in cardboard moving boxes or in opaque plastic bins. The movers had no clue what they were moving. Other preps were in five and six gallon buckets clearly marked as wheat, flour, beans, and other types of long term food storage. Can you say oops. So much for OPSEC, as anyone that watched Doomsday Preppers or any other preparedness show would know exactly what it was. They asked, and I said I did a LOT of camping, and tried to reinforce it with my three various size tents, and many sleeping bags. I\u2019m not too sure they bought it.\nAs for guns, ammunition, gasoline, and other items a moving company prohibit, I did move myself the day before the official move. I didn\u2019t want anyone to see them or how many of them. Good thing the neighborhood we bought the house in is relatively quiet.\nWe\u2019ve been in the house now for almost five months. Everytime I look in the garage, I cringe at all the work there is to do. My mistake was not having a solid plan around moving and organizing my preps. Had I had the time, and access to the house early enough, I would have moved the preps earlier, organized everything, and felt more comfortable about it. Meaning, I really need to get my Bug Out Bag off the floor in the furthest corner of the garage so that it is accessible, get the generator out so that it is accessible, etc.\nThe moral of the story is, have a plan to stay organized, and stick to it if you plan on moving your preps to a new home or a new location.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T20:36:34Z", "url": "https://suburbansurvivalblog.com/prepping-and-moving-and-lots-of-stuff/", "byte_size": 3252, "char_size": 3232}

Especially the sidings next to the yard, because they don\u2019t have fencing or anything. Because that paint on 84 is definitely new!\nAgreed on the 3 car services. There is still one running from Caboolture to Ipswich in peak time which is ridiculous.\nSeen an NGR and EMU 26 I think both in new graffiti livery today.\nYes rather it is quite odd to be retiring sets when I\u2019ve seen a few Cabooltures (and the occasional Redcliffe) only using 3-car sets.\nBeen a while since I\u2019ve seen weird slogans on the train displays.\nYesterday most cleveland line pm peak trains were EMU units, which the exception of that one manly train that is always an IMU.\nJust saw a 3-car Ipswich this morning at like 7:30 and it was jam-packed, people were standing everywhere.\nThere must be 6-7 NGRs on Kippa-Ring runs today, certainly changing the emus onto other services quickly now.\nVery low on sightings around Milton today.\nI really don\u2019t like the design of the new NGRs. There\u2019s very low visibility everywhere and I\u2019ve been in at least two occasions where I almost sat on top of another person just because I couldn\u2019t see them there.\nMaybe a line continuing from Springfield with a Springfield West or south something on the cards? Bit like Mango Hill and Mango Hill East?? who knows.\nWhich line will the Toowoomba - Brisbane trains take??\n103 & 106 at Milton on 4.08pm to Kippa-Ring again!!\nGot really bad sightings yesterday, only one! 21 3-car with no display at Roma St.\nToday got some better results, with 85 & 86 pair being broken up, 85 with 40 and I haven\u2019t seen 86 yet.\nThe other Bandicoot pair of 81 & 82 wasn\u2019t seen but 86 was today, see below.\nWith 67? At Bowen Hills depot I\u2019m after the other bandicoot which arrived around the same time which is still parked up close to the Ferny Grove bridge.\n@Skyblue1 yep I\u2019ve been trying to see that one as well but from the north side the big blocks holding up the Ferny rails block it, and from the south there just isn\u2019t that good of a view. Weird to think that some of the 60s might still be in Mayne just outside of view.\nArgh the NGRs are actually the worst when it comes to visibility. Couldn\u2019t keep an eye on 84 and 104 but I think 67 got moved into the Servicing Shed (or it was moved behind the S/IMU which was the only one I could see). Will keep an eye out this afternoon.\nBit late with yesterday\u2019s list.\nMorning all! 37 has moved on from being paired with 04, now it\u2019s with 23.\nI think QR\u2019s up to 740 with the NGR fleet. Saw 734 \u2018Test Train\u2019 a couple days ago.\nYes NGR 740 been seen a few times on Kippa-Ring runs.\nYesterday I noticed 67? Being moved around Bowen Hills with doors open so may have departed with the other half bandicoot (yellow non drivers end and bandicoot drivers end) that was parked near Ferny Grove bridge.\nAnyway. Yesterday\u2019s low count sightings.\nJust gone past Bowen Hills depot and seen what looks like either an EMU/IMU/SMU with 1 piece windows instead of split windows down the whole of one side. New upgrade ??\nDidn\u2019t see it this morning, was busy on my laptop, will check this arvo. Is it really far in the Yard (considering you couldn\u2019t even tell what type it was)?\nOnly got 42 & 83 and 82 & 43 (is it a coincidence?) on the Roma and a northbohnd run respectively.\nVery low day on Emu counts again today.\nEMUs seem to be thin on the ground over the last 2 days, very bizarre. Maybe some more gone into storage we don\u2019t know about??\n14 & 79 in Mayne Yard, 84 & 104 now gone.\nYep 14 and 79 have taken their place, yesterday afternoon neither were in the Yards so I assume they were moved in last night?\nI agree there have been less EMUs to sight, but for some reason I managed to catch 3 out of 4 EMUs on my daily trip yesterday.\nI think I got a brief glimpse of the train without the stem in between the windows, it was moving though so I couldn\u2019t classify it.\nThe 80s series has been working rather hard these past few days though, I\u2019ve seen them on multiple occasions basically every day this past week.\nYesterday was a bit more rewarding with sightings.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T00:38:59Z", "url": "http://railpage.com.au/f-p2124043.htm", "byte_size": 4214, "char_size": 4166}

Although the parties of the festive season are over, there is plenty to look forward to in the months ahead for everyone at SVM.\nNew projects arriving early this year include some design for station gateline installations and some external lighting works for Railway Bridges. We have also been asked to return to our old stomping ground at Haymarket for two separate schemes requiring design advice on lighting and power and approach a new phase of works at Dundee Station. In the commercial sector we are looking at some new hotel works both close to home in Glasgow and in Argyll and Bute where site visits have already been undertaken. Looking towards the future, we have also tendered several bids this month for works including railway stabling sheds and subway locations both at home and in London.\nThere are of course several ongoing projects this month with the large scale works at EGIP, PARR and Motherwell North Signalling Renewals progressing nicely and approaching submission. Also running smoothly are our \u2018access for all projects\u2019 at Railways locations across Scotland and LED replacement works at various Scottish stations. We are currently involved in works with several Railway Depots with sites located in the Glasgow, Edinburgh and Perthshire areas under the instruction of various different clients and works include external lighting, boiler works and design. Below ground our site supervision for some of Glasgow Subway\u2019s stations is ongoing and well under control. Stepping off the train, our non-railway projects make for a nice stopping place with Heartlands oil related manufacturing development winding down and works in our neighbouring office buildings winding up while our CAD specialist continues to field any new educations suites requiring 3D modelling.\nLooking to the past successful year we are very pleased to have worked with all our clients and collaborators and hope that a fruitful relationship continues into the year ahead.

For those of you who haven&apos;t heard of Krampusnacht, it is the night before Saint Nicholas Day where the demonic creature Krampus comes and takes naughty children to hell. Okay, so that sounds a little morbid, but it&apos;s actually a rising phenomenon in pop culture. Krampus, a sort of anti-Santa Claus, was a well-known mythological creature back in the day, and now has made a huge comeback. Whether it&apos;s a more traditional European celebration of guys and gals dressed as the creature running around the streets or the American spin on him, such as his strange cameos on The Colbert Reportand The Venture Bros., the Krampus fad seems here to stay. Back in the mid-1800s, it was customary to send out greeting cards from Krampus \"signed\" by the being with \"Gruss vom Krampus.\" The cards serve as fun and eerie reminders that instead of Santa doling out coal, Krampus is there to take disobedient kids (and sometimes their parents) on a midnight journey through hell. So sit back, and take a look at some of these amazingly creepy vintage greeting cards from Krampus and enjoy this strange, mysterious December holiday.\nLooks like this girl made the naughty list.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T10:18:50Z", "url": "https://www.inkedmag.com/culture/vintage-greeting-cards-krampus", "byte_size": 1353, "char_size": 1353}

{"text": "If you\u2019re a fan of fantasy-themed games, you\u2019ll no doubt be very much enchanted by the Novomatic release, \u2018Secret Forest\u2019. It\u2019s full of fairy, elf and gnome magic, providing players with a transportation to another world. It\u2019s a little unfortunate that the interface is set up to include much of what would be considered a traditional slot machine cabinet, otherwise the developer could have had some fun with providing a foliage-based background and surroundings. However, this is not the biggest mishap with this game. Instead, they still haven\u2019t seen the error of their ways, and have seen fit to incorporate their tired old arcade noises into this every time the reels spin. Audio should be concentrated on as well as the visuals, and it just seems like Novomatic haven\u2019t really bothered thinking about it too much. However, with this nuance put aside, Secret Forest offers up an easy and relaxing game to play.\nThere are a total of five reels in this game, and these are accompanied by three rows, which presents a standard layout for frequent online video slots players. Upon these reels, various icons relating to the game\u2019s theme can be found, including a griffin, a blonde-haired fairy, a golden-horned unicorn, trees with faces, white-spotted toadstools, two gnomes and a regal castle. Furthermore, the addition of A, J, Q, K, 9 and 10 icons can also be seen. These icons are wonderfully animated and very intricately designed, providing a very visually appealing product.\nIn addition to these reels and rows, Novomatic have added a total of nine separate pay lines. All of these are able to be easily altered, ranging from a single one up to three, five, seven and the maximum of nine. Furthermore, the value of a single credit in the game can be changed between $0.50 and up to $1 and finally, $2. Also, players are also able to change around the bet placed per line, which will range from its minimum of one and increase up to the maximum of 100. Overall, players are able to place a maximum wager per round of $900.\nA large amount of features are usually added in to the best games, and while Secret Forest does have a few, it\u2019s not overwhelmed by them. Its specialities start off with its wild icon, and this is represented by the previously mentioned blonde-haired fairy. She will act as a substitute for all other icons on the reels, except for the scatters, and in doing so, will contribute towards providing a winning combination. Not only that, but she\u2019ll also double the pay out of any winnings.\nIn addition to this, you\u2019ll be able to see a scatter icon in view, which is represented by the trees with faces. Should you manage to spin three or more of these into any location on the reels, you\u2019ll be rewarded with 15 freespins. During this round, any pay outs will be tripled and freespins can be re-triggered as well.\nNovomatic have also added their regular gamble feature to the game, which provides all players with the opportunity to try and increase their winnings. It is triggered after every winning round during the main game, and will offer you up the possibility of playing a side game to do so. Should you choose to do this, you will be taken to a new screen. This will present you with a deck of playing cards, and you will need to guess the colour of the next playing card to be turned over. If you manage to do this correctly, you will see your winnings doubled. Alternatively, if you don\u2019t guess correctly, your winnings will be lost.\nThis game presents a wonderfully magical game, which is filled with visually pleasing animations and graphics. It\u2019s a shame about the previously noted music and interface, but gamers will be pleased to spend their time gazing upon intricately crafted symbols as they spin the reels.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T05:51:49Z", "url": "http://www.mrgamez.com/novomatic/secret-forest/", "byte_size": 3783, "char_size": 3753}
{"text": "Multimedia artist Joyce Yu-Jean Lee presented footage of her art installations, which exemplify how visual culture shapes notions of truth and the \u201cother\u201d on Friday, Feb. 16 in Kendall Hall as part of the College\u2019s Brown Bag series.\nLee, who teaches at New Jersey City University and the Fashion Institute of Technology, had no plans to become an artist in her early life. She attended the University of Pennsylvania as a double major in communications and psychology with plans to work in fashion marketing. Two weeks after she returned to school from her summer internship in New York City, some of Penn\u2019s Wharton School of Business alumni who worked at the World Trade Center were killed during the 9/11 attacks. This changed the way Lee saw the world.\n\u201cIf I die tomorrow, with no warning whatsoever, what do I want to be in the middle of doing?\u201d Lee recalled asking herself at the time.\nLee turned to art to process what was happening and make sense of the influx of information and images coming from the media following the 9/11 attacks.\nToday, Lee is highly selective in the way she consumes news. She does not watch or own a television. Lee believes our relationship with the media has a profound impact on the way we understand society and view others.\n\u201cWhile contemporary media washes over us, we can sometimes get lulled to sleep and we don\u2019t realize what\u2019s happening,\u201d Lee said.\nShe encouraged the audience to pause and consider how media influences their perspective of the world around them.\nLee\u2019s recent project, FIREWALL, a pop-up interactive art installation, was displayed at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and the Oslo Freedom Forum in Norway. The project compared the disparities of America\u2019s Google search engine to China\u2019s Baidu in an effort to shed insight on how internet censorship produces different results in different countries, and to create discussion about internet rights and freedoms.\nFIREWALL garnered the attention of Chinese authorities when Lu Miaoqing, the only lawyer to win two cases over China\u2019s single child policy, prepared to participate on Lee\u2019s feminist activists panel. The night before the panel, the Chinese government reached out to Miaoqing\u2019s law firm and forbade her to work with Lee or to ever speak publicly again. Miaoqing is now on academic asylum in the U.S.\nLee\u2019s latest exhibit, State of the DysUnion, is on display at NJCU\u2019s Visual Arts Gallery until March 1. This project presents a snapshot of today\u2019s journalism, advertising and the internet influenced by \u201calternative facts\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d discussed in the media.\nThe project is displayed as an eight-foot cylindrical screen.\nThe first chapter shows a variety of news clippings, that include both liberal and conservative articles.\nThe piece rotates front-page international news stories from the day Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election.\nThe next chapter of the installation shows drone footage of the first Women\u2019s March in 2017, from every location around the world, overlaid with footage from this past summer\u2019s California wildfire. The piece showcases the magnitude of the reaction to Trump\u2019s election while the wildfire footage represents how the media builds energy of its own.\nLee uses her art to help figure out how to navigate personal agency in the midst of today\u2019s confusing media landscape.\nIn her 2012 performative activist exhibition, Made in China, at (e)merge Art Fair, Lee dressed up as a Chinese factory worker with a peddler\u2019s cart who created limited edition works of art. Behind her, a screen displayed other factory workers making the products she was selling. This project served as an effort to point at the hypocrisy surrounding the U.S.\u2019 relationship with China and trade.\nLee feels that artists have a specific role in society \u2014 to function as a mouthpiece. They produce works based on the emotions and conditions of the present day, operating as a societal barometer.\nThrough her art, Lee hopes to continue to serve American culture by highlighting important issues that often go undiscussed, and by challenging our country\u2019s standards for communication.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T20:49:59Z", "url": "http://www.tcnjsignal.net/2018/02/20/professor-creates-political-commentary-through-art/", "byte_size": 4197, "char_size": 4135}

{"text": "In the last post I discussed some of the issues surrounding gifting the family vineyard to your family. There are a number of reasons that a person or a couple might consider just giving their property. However, the primary factor in that decision process is: control over the decision. If you make a gift, that means that you are alive and able to consciously make the decision to give your property to another person, family or otherwise.\nIf you are dead, then you can no longer consciously decide. Your property is distributed the way your estate plan dictates. Now, if you\u2019ve done a good job preparing your estate plan, then that distribution may happen exactly the way you wanted it to. Or maybe not\u2026you just won\u2019t know for sure\u2026because you are dead.\nSo the trade-off between giving property during your life (gifting) and leaving property to someone in your estate (a bequest) is that of trading off decision making control for tax benefits in the form of a step-up in basis. Let me explain.\nLet\u2019s use the previous example, and say that you originally bought your 100 acre Napa vineyard in 1978 for $200,000. You planted some grapes, raised your family, and enjoyed the farm life of growing grapes. Now, forty years later, that vineyard with prime Napa Cab is valued at $250,000 per acre. The property is worth $25 million. If you sell it, you have a capital gain on the value it sells for, less what you paid for it ($25 million \u2013 $200,000), and will pay capital gains taxes on that amount, approximately $5 million.\nHowever, if you leave it to your estate, your heirs will receive a \u201cstep-up in basis\u201d on the property. That means that for tax purposes they will acquire the property at it\u2019s current value, basically what it\u2019s worth upon your death. After they jump through the hoops to get the property properly titled in their names, they will be able to turn around and sell the property without incurring any capital gains tax.\nThat is a pretty nice perk of receiving property as an inheritance. Again, the only thing you must do to be able to take advantage of this perk\u2026is, well, give up control\u2026forever.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T12:41:34Z", "url": "http://thevintageplanner.com/strategies-for-passing-the-family-vineyard-leaving-it-to-the-estate-part-2/", "byte_size": 2141, "char_size": 2117}

So comfortable, I can't get out of it in the morning. ;-) He even delivered the mattress FREE.\nThanks Mike, you're a life saver!\n5 starWe were looking for a full size mattress for our son, but did not want to spend a lot of money. I saw a sign for Sage and we decided to check it out. Mike was very nice to work with. Mike was extremely knowledgeable about mattresses. We got a great deal and next day delivery. We will definitely be recommending Sage to others!\n5 starI've now purchased 2 mattresses from Mike the most recent for my daughter. After realizing the new mattress was a lot higher than her old one he ordered her a low profile box spring for no additional charge. The quality of his product and his customer service are top notch. Would definitely recommend him to friends and family.\n5 starWe got our new mattress at Sage yesterday. The store is unassuming from the outside but inside the staff are friendly and knowledgeable The mattresses are excellent and there is no pressure or rush. Spent last night on the new mattress and it is so nice. We got the somerton, I have chronic pain issues and this is the best sleep I have had in a long time. When we figure out what we need for furniture Sage will be where we go! Keep up the good work, Mike!\n5 starIf you want OUTSTANDING customer service and the absolute BEST price for a quality mattress, I strongly recommend Mike Sages's Home Furnishing store! Wow! So completely impressed!\n5 starGREAT customer service and great prices! Mike takes the time to explain all of your options so you know what you are buying beforehand. He is very informative and never pushy - I felt completely comfortable the entire time. His prices are unbeatable and his service is outstanding! I would highly recommend Sage Home Furnishings!!\n5 starAbsolutely love this place, friendly and help me with the mattress I wanted. I absolutely would buy more.\n5 starI had a truly awesome experience at Sage Home Furnishings. I got exactly what I wanted for a lower price than everywhere else I looked, including the delivery. Even better, the quality of the mattress I bought was even better than I remembered it from the show floor. I will definitely purchase from Mike again, and highly recommend Sage Home Furnishings.\n\"Fantastic service, excellent selection of mattresses. Great prices. My wallet & back both thank Sage Home Furnishings! :)\" Jay Mitchell Jr.\nWe love the new bed, it was VERY comfortable and we slept really well through the night and woke up with no more pain. The service with Mike is wonderful. He was willing to take time to help us to understand the finance works and making sure we understand without no confusion. He is a wonderful man to work with and I recommended the new customers to Mike and he will guide you to the right place.\n\"I think that I was one of Mike's first customers. I found his ad on Craigslist, and figured I would try a vendor outside of the standard retail establishments. I am glad I did.\nThe prices on his post were quite competitive compared to everything else that I saw online. My wife and I had just purchased a new home, and needed new furniture, so this seemed to be an obvious fit.\nMike made it clear right out of the gate that he has plenty of experience in furniture retail, but doesn't agree with many of its standard practices. He walked us through the products on his (then still in development) showroom floor. He has a range of products, but made it clear that the range is focused on price with a default towards quality.\nOnce we decided on the right king-sized TLC mattress, Mike worked with us on the pricing and delivery. CC payment was no problem. Mike and his teammate showed up a couple of days later and carefully delivered the mattress and box spring, and into a great night's sleep we went.\nThe interesting part was a couple of days later when I ran to BJ's Wholesale to grab a cheapo queen set for the guest room. Their prices were easily twice what Mike's were! Having seen his products already, I walked out of BJ's, called Mike, and asked him to add a queen set to the order. Mike showed up again a couple of days later with the second set, and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.\nI recently had the pleasure of purchasing a new mattress and box spring. Mike was knowledgable about his product and answered all of my questions. Financing was easy. I had been to a few other mattress locations and found their high pressure approach bothersome when I told them I was just looking. I felt just as comfortable with my sales experience as my new purchase.\nMy boyfriend and I recently moved to Syracuse from Washington DC and were search of a good mattress for our guest bedroom. Because it was a spare bedroom, we were not trying to pay a fortune.\nWe ran across this store and was pleasantly surprised by the owner and his dedication to selling quality mattresses.

{"text": "Doyenne Group (DG): What business do you own?\nDG:What is your background? What got you to where you are now?\nDT: I\u2019m a writer and an editor. I started my career as a high school teacher in Texas, where I taught English, French and journalism. I came home to Wisconsin and taught those same subjects here, too. I left teaching to become a full-time writer and editor at Madison Newspapers (now Capital Newspapers), Epic Systems and Magna Publications. I did some freelance writing and editing on the side and I started a popular blog (now offline).\nDG: What made you decide to start your business?\nDT: My husband landed a position in Sheboygan and I thought I might try freelance writing and editing full time. I met my partners in an online content writing agency and we had similar work ethics and beliefs. We were dissatisfied with the agency where we worked, so we decided to form our own business. We knew that we could deliver a better product while respecting the clients and our writers. I feel really lucky. My partners and I get along really well and our aptitudes and interests complement one another. We make one another stronger and we work hard.\nDG:What is your biggest accomplishment so far in life and why?\nDT: My biggest life accomplishment is raising my daughter to be a happy, successful adult who is a good parent.\nDG: What is your biggest accomplishment in your business and why?\nDT: My biggest business accomplishment is to have a functional partnership. I know that we go further as a business because we three work together so well. We don\u2019t always agree, but we talk and work things out. Our partnership functions better than many marriages and I know that we have something rare and precious. Nurturing this partnership is a huge accomplishment.\nDG: What is the biggest obstacle that you have face while in business? What is the biggest fear that you have for your business?\nDT: Our biggest obstacle is how to scale our operations. For me, it\u2019s tough to give up editorial control because I want to make sure our product is consistently good. We work with remote freelancers who are often inconsistent workers. When we find good ones, we hold on to them with both hands and nurture them so we can retain them. We have some redundancy built into our process, but when writers or editors drop the ball, someone has to pick it up. We\u2019re working toward the three of us partners picking up the ball less often, but we deliver client projects on time, so sometimes that means sacrifices. My biggest fear is not figuring out the scaling piece. We need to figure out how the three of us can work on growing the business more and working directly on client work less. I\u2019m convinced the only way to work less and earn more is to expand operations and revenue streams.\nDG: If you could give one quote to live by, what would it be?\nDG: What words of advice do you have for aspiring entrepreneurs?\nDT: Don\u2019t give up. When things look difficult, step back and think your way through the situation and plan a strategy. Don\u2019t get mired in the day-to-day details and remember to enjoy yourself, even when the days are long.\nDG: What does Madison need to encourage entrepreneurs to stay and grow their businesses?\nDT: Take advantage of all of the resources available to you. There are so many in Madison, Doyenne being a big one! But also places like 100State where I work, StartingBlock, Forward Fest, Capital Entrepreneurs, Merlin Mentors, the Law and Entrepreneurship clinic and more.\nAlso, think hard about what your ideal work-life balance looks like, by moving away from doing client work myself, my hours have decreased but my income has increased as I\u2019ve been able to grow our client base. How can you leverage other people and technological solutions to free up your own time? Also, consider starting your business or testing the waters as a side-gig. It can be challenging to give up the comfort and reliability of a regular paycheck, but if you can build up your product or service offering and start to build a client base before you take the plunge, it will be easier to do.\nDT: This isn\u2019t a Madison-only problem, but I think health insurance is something that holds people back from leaving their corporate jobs and jumping into entrepreneurship. The affordable care act has made it easier to get coverage but it is often prohibitively expensive. It would be great to see one of the Madison-area entrepreneurship organizations could facilitate a group-rate on insurance for solo-preneurs or early stage companies.\nJoin us at our monthly Connect Event on Wednesday, November 28 from 6-8pm for an evening of networking with other women professionals and a presentation from this inspirational entrepreneur.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T10:33:05Z", "url": "https://doyennegroup.org/featured-entrepreneur-diane-trim-2/", "byte_size": 4742, "char_size": 4724}

{"text": "If for some reason wild baby mice have been placed in your care, I have included a few tips on caring and feeding to help you give them a chance at life. Please be aware that even in the wild, mice have a 50% chance of surviving beyond 5 months of age, given a normal upbringing. The mice that do make it can live up to around 5 years if healthy. A pair will have a better chance of survival than a lone mouse.\nAs soon as you have your baby mice, it is important to keep them safe and warm. You can use a small pet carrier, large plastic tub or any other suitable box in which you can put them. Layer the bottom with a towel and place the mice on top. Then, use another soft material to lightly cover the mice like fleece. Place the box in a warm place, ensuring that it is not hot; otherwise the mice will become dehydrated. A heater on the lowest setting may be all that is needed. Test the towel the mice are laying on so that it feels cosy and warm to your hand.\nIf the baby mice are less than 14 days old they will need dropper fed with a milk substitute until they are weaned. They usually open their eyes when they are just about weaned and able to eat by themselves. You will need to feed them every 2 hours so be prepared to get up during the night. Set your alarm. When I was looking after wild mice, I was getting up every 2 hours to check them. I have since read that during the night mother mouse would be away looking for food and may only return to the nest once to feed her babies. Use common sense, if you can manage a few night feeds, all the best for the babies chance of survival, especially in the early days.\nKitten milk is available to buy at pet shops. I used raw coconut blended up and strained. It should be 1 cup coconut to about 2 and \u00bd cups water. You could also use soaked almonds to make an almond milk using the same ratios. Make sure the nuts are natural and plain. Once you've made up the milk, store in a sterilised glass jar and keep in the fridge until required. When you go to feed the mice, take a quarter a cup of the milk and warm it up by pouring it in a small jug and standing in hot water. Use a dropper or baby syringe (you can get these at the chemist) to feed 1 or 2 drops of the milk at a time into the baby mouse mouth. When the mice are really young, they might not open their mouth. Be careful not to get the milk up their noses, they will splutter / cough if you do. It can be dangerous for their health if you do. The way I fed the mice was to put a facecloth down on a table and to put one mouse at a time onto it. Then you can gently hold the baby's head whilst you administer the milk with the dropper. You'll get the hang of it with a bit of practise. The baby might not seem to be taking much milk, do not worry. Very young babies may only need to get a drop or 2 on their mouth / tongues until they can take more. The main purpose here is to keep them hydrated with a little drop at a time every couple of hours.\nOnce the baby is fed, you need to stimulate a bowel movement. To do this, put some warm water in a small bowl and dip a cotton bud into it. Then, put the cotton bud between the baby's back legs and gently turn the bud around. You should see a little brown staining, that is their poo. Dip the other end of the bud into the water and gently stroke the baby's body, this emulates the mother licking them. After all that, tuck baby up in it's soft bedding and place in a warm spot. This is the basic routine that needs to be repeated every couple of hours during the day and at least 2-3 times during the night, especially around 1am and 5am.\nAs you can see, it's quite a commitment, looking after baby wild mice. But, there is also a great reward in the caring of them and the bonding you will feel as a carer.\nWhen the babies start to open their eyes or at least take a peak, they may be taking a lot more milk and starting to walk around a little. This is when you need to be extra careful; one fall is enough to be fatal. You can make a little safe roaming area in the bottom part of a pet cage or shoebox / basin. Line it with newspaper and leaves to simulate a natural environment. The youngsters will enjoy stretching their legs and taking their first steps. This is important, as it will build up their muscles and strength.\nOnce the babies start to bite your fingers quite firmly when you feed them, they may be ready for a little solid food. They will also be starting to open their eyes (12-14 days old) Start very slowly with this. Try some baby fruit puree to start or natural rice pudding. The food should not be chilled. Let them lick it off your finger. Avoid putting the purees onto a dish for the mice to feed from, as they might get messy and end up with matted fur, which needs to be avoided. Some other foods to graduate to are porridge, banana, tomato, dried oat flakes, strawberry. Just go real easy with the food and keep it simple and easily digested to start with. Congratulations! You've actually made it to the weaning stage, which is quite something with wild baby mice.\nContinue to provide a safe space for the mice to sleep and once weaned, they will be able to come out at night to feed. Give them a little dish near their bed so they can feed during the night. At least you can get some sleep now! Continue to offer the milk during the day and provide some water for them. Usually, wild mice will still have some mothers milk up to about 4 weeks of age.\nNow you have to decide whether to keep them or release into the wild. I do not know how many mice have been successfully hand-reared and released into the wild. I would think it unlikely that they can survive. However, you've done your bit and if they seem strong and healthy and quite active, it might be possible to release them. Or, you can keep them as pets.\nFinally, if you did your best and the mice died, do not feel bad. Survival chances in the best of conditions ie with their natural mother are still low. Just enjoy the experience you've had with them and the opportunity to get a glimpse into their little lives. They are little bundles of love and it is wonderful to have at least given them some love when otherwise they might have perished.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T14:29:57Z", "url": "http://www.aboutdirectories.com/care-of-wild-baby-mice.html", "byte_size": 6212, "char_size": 6211}
{"text": "10 - On The Geological Succession of Organic Beings 10-05 - On Extinction 10 We have as yet spoken only incidentally of the disappearance of species and of groups of species.\nOn the theory of natural selection the extinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are intimately connected together.\nThe old notion of all the inhabitants of the earth having been swept away at successive periods by catastrophes, is very generally given up, even by those geologists, as Elie de Beaumont, Murchison, Barrande, &c., whose general views would naturally lead them to this conclusion.\nOn the contrary, we have every reason to believe, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and groups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one spot, then from another, and finally from the world.\nBoth single species and whole groups of species last for very unequal periods; some groups, as we have seen, having endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the present day; some having disappeared before the close of the palaeozoic period.\nNo fixed law seems to determine the length of time during which any single species or any single genus endures.\nThere is reason to believe that the complete extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower process than their production: if the appearance and disappearance of a group of species be represented, as before, by a vertical line of varying thickness, the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end, which marks the progress of extermination, than at its lower end, which marks the first appearance and increase in numbers of the species.\nIn some cases, however, the extermination of whole groups of beings, as of ammonites towards the close of the secondary period, has been wonderfully sudden.\nThe whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous mystery.\nSome authors have even supposed that as the individual has a definite length of life, so have species a definite duration.\nNo one I think can have marvelled more at the extinction of species, than I have done.\nWhen I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon, and other extinct monsters, which all co-existed with still living shells at a very late geological period, I was filled with astonishment; for seeing that the horse, since its introduction by the Spaniards into South America, has run wild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate, I asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently so favourable.\nBut how utterly groundless was my astonishment! Professor Owen soon perceived that the tooth, though so like that of the existing horse, belonged to an extinct species.\nHad this horse been still living, but in some degree rare, no naturalist would have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the attribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all countries.\nIf we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we answer that something is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but what that something is, we can hardly ever tell.\nOn the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt certain from the analogy of all other mammals, even of the slow-breeding elephant, and from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in South America, that under more favourable conditions it would in a very few years have stocked the whole continent.\nBut we could not have told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase, whether some one or several contingencies, and at what period of the horse's life, and in what degree, they severally acted.\nIf the conditions had gone on, however slowly, becoming less and less favourable, we assuredly should not have perceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would certainly have become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct; its place being seized on by some more successful competitor.\nI may repeat what I published in 1845, namely, that to admit that species generally become rare before they become extinct to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species, and yet to marvel greatly when it ceases to exist, is much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death to feel no surprise at sickness, but when the sick man dies, to wonder and to suspect that he died by some unknown deed of violence.\nThe theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably follows.\nIt is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and slightly improved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it is transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the place of other breeds in other countries.\nThus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old forms, both natural and artificial, are bound together.\nIn certain flourishing groups, the number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given time is probably greater than that of the old forms which have been exterminated; but we know that the number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least during the later geological periods, so that looking to later times we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the same number of old forms.\nThe competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained and illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each other in all respects.\nHence the improved and modified descendants of a species will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species; and if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the nearest allies of that species, i.e. the species of the same genus, will be the most liable to extermination.\nThus, as I believe, a number of new species descended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to supplant an old genus, belonging to the same family.\nBut it must often have happened that a new species belonging to some one group will have seized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group, and thus caused its extermination; and if many allied forms be developed from the successful intruder, many will have to yield their places; and it will generally be allied forms, which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common.\nFor instance, a single species of Trigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary formations, survives in the Australian seas; and a few members of the great and almost extinct group of Ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters.\nTherefore the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have seen, a slower process than its production.\nWith respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or orders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic period and of Ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our consecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been much slow extermination.\nMoreover, when by sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development, many species of a new group have taken possession of a new area, they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner many of the old inhabitants; and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of some inferiority in common.\nThus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole groups of species become extinct, accords well with the theory of natural selection.\nIf we forget for an instant, that each species tends to increase inordinately, and that some check is always in action, yet seldom perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured.\nWhenever we can precisely say why this species is more abundant in individuals than that; why this species and not another can be naturalised in a given country; then, and not till then, we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of this particular species or group of species.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T06:19:22Z", "url": "http://theora.com/mbrowse/msdb/OriginOfSpecies/title/is/10-05+-+On+Extinction/", "byte_size": 8461, "char_size": 8461}

{"text": "If you\u2019re thinking of applying for a loan to buy a house here in Shelby County, it\u2019s easier than ever to get confused, given the incredible variety of loans offered by banks, loan companies, credit unions and other groups. It\u2019s also possible to completely overlook what could be the perfect loan program, which is all the more reason why you should have a knowledgeable lender helping you.\nFirst Step and Step Up are two more loan programs you should know about. These are bond money loans offered by the State of Alabama, and have wound up helping many home buyers in our area. First Federal Mortgage Loan Officer KC Haririan, who joined us for our Netcast last month, is back with us again to talk about these two programs (he has plenty of experience with helping buyers apply for both).\nWe also discuss the current lending climate here in Shelby County, and what you\u2019re about to hear may surprise you. With all the media attention devoted to the credit crunch, a lot of folks may be shying away, thinking they have no chance of qualifying for a loan. But as we learn from KC, that\u2019s not always necessarily true.\nClick the player just below to listen to our latest Netcast interview with KC\u2013we hope you enjoy it, and that you find the information useful.\nPricing Right in Shelby County Pays!\nOkay, we know. You\u2019ve heard the line about how important pricing your home can be. But would you like to see a real world example of how this works here in Shelby county? Consider the case of several homes for sale in one part of Alabaster.\nWe looked at the sales of single level homes during the past six months (this was done as part of a Comparative Market Analysis we ran for a client who lives in the neighborhood). For all the homes that sold during the six month period, the average number of days on market was 73, and the average selling price was $ 147,000. On average, the homes that sold got 98.7% of their asking price. Not bad, huh!\nObviously, not all homes for sale in the neighborhood have sold during that six month time frame. Those single level homes still for sale (active listings) in the same area have been on the market for an average of 130 days, or nearly twice as long as the houses that sold. And the average asking price for those same homes is between $ 155,000 and $ 165,000. So, do these numbers say anything? You bet.\nTo me, that\u2019s a true reflection that these houses are simply overpriced.\nSo, what does all this mean? Simple. Pricing is your key to controlling how soon you want to sell your home. Like it or not, price is a clear indicator of a homeowner\u2019s true motivation to sell. The price you select will help decide whether you enjoy the sweet smell of success in a shorter time frame, or whether your house stays (and stays!) on the market for many weeks or months longer.\nAre you hearing talk among some sellers that the Shelby County housing market has gone soft? Don\u2019t believe it. Homes are selling. The simple fact is that buyers are looking for the best deals they can find, and are passing up those homes they consider priced too high.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T02:24:46Z", "url": "https://theblackteam.wordpress.com/2007/10/", "byte_size": 3097, "char_size": 3077}

{"text": "\u201cBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\u201d \u2013 Benjamin Franklin, Scientist, Inventor, Statesman.\nIt\u2019s early January and many New Year\u2019s resolutions have already fallen by the wayside. If there\u2019s room for one more on your list, I encourage you to add this one: Preparation.\nAnyone who has painted a room knows the importance of properly preparing before painting. Proper preparation generally takes more time than painting itself and can be tedious, which is why many choose to skip or cut short this step in favor of \u201cjust getting on with it.\u201d A true professional might get away with less prep than the average person, but a sloppy job is a constant reminder that cutting corners rarely pays. Doing the job right from the start requires a good plan, patience, and discipline. The resulting satisfaction from a job well done likely includes the realization of how important those preparation steps were to the process.\nIn sales, the need to prepare is no different. Even the greenest sales rookie knows to take time to prepare before a sales meeting or call. But what\u2019s the proper way to prepare? What boxes should you check before proceeding?\nLook at the big picture. Where are you in the sales cycle with this client? What do you hope to achieve as a result of the meeting? Envision how you want the meeting to end and then build from there.\nWhat are the possible curveballs that can be thrown your way and how can you avoid them? The devil is in the details, and knowing what challenges may arise and how to overcome them will greatly aid your level of preparedness.\nThis step includes multiple layers to be researched and explored before sitting down with your client.\nCompany \u2013 What does the company do? How do they make money? Who are their customers and what do they want? What division are you targeting? Is the company growing, stagnant, or struggling to compete? Has their leadership changed recently? What does the company say about themselves, and what are others saying about them?\nIndividual buyers \u2013 Hopefully you have an internal project champion to help guide you. Try to find out about your target buyer and influencers. How senior are they? What\u2019s their position and role? Is their focus local, regional, national, or international? Do they have buying authority, or are they researching for their boss? Look them up on LinkedIn to find out what groups they belong to and whether or not you have any common contacts and to see what topics they are posting or commenting on to get a sense of their level of experience and sophistication.\nCompetitors \u2013 Who are your target\u2019s key competitors and what are they up to? How might that influence your sale? Is your target leading their industry or playing catch up?\nPast projects or history \u2013 Have your companies worked together in the past? Not doing your internal homework is a rookie mistake that can make you look really bad in front of the prospect. Even the smallest project in another business unit from 10 years ago counts as history. Know who did what, when, for how much, and with what results before talking to your buyer.\nOnce you have answered the strategic and client questions, you need to align that information with your company\u2019s products, services, and capabilities.\nCapabilities \u2013 What challenges do they face that you can help resolve? How do your products or services fill a void, fix a problem, or otherwise help them improve their business? What features and benefits of your services directly relate to their needs? Don\u2019t drown them in every last detail about your business, but rather pick your specific capabilities that can help the client.\nIndustry and market trends \u2013 What are the trends across the industry? Not only should you know what\u2019s going on, but try to dig deeper to uncover an insight that would be of interest to your prospect. It could be something they already know but perhaps weren\u2019t aware of the scope, or it might be something significant that presents a threat or opportunity. Show that you\u2019ve done your homework, but be careful to be respectful and not insulting when presenting the insight.\nObjections \u2013 How would you respond if confronted with \u201cWe don\u2019t need your help \u2013 we can do it ourselves. You\u2019re only here because my boss wants a dog-and-pony show.\u201d What other objections might you face and how would you overcome them?\nWhere should you look for answers to these questions? Search Google, LinkedIn, Twitter. Industry publication websites are also great sources of information. Simple keyword searches will usually yield helpful results beginning with basics such as \u201cbanking industry trends\u201d or \u201ctop issues in banking 2014.\u201d Of course, using keywords that are specific to their business or issues will get you more granular results.\nWe\u2019ve all been guilty of Ready-Fire-Aim at some point. But when it becomes an everyday habit, your ability to be successful will likely be extremely compromised. Good preparation takes thought, time, and discipline to set yourself up for success (and avoid failure). Sales managers need to encourage action and monitor progress, but also to instill the importance of properly preparing for sales meetings and calls. As you look to the New Year ahead, resolve to make preparation a priority.\nWhat are your tips for preparing for client meetings? What pitfalls have you encountered along the way? Please share your thoughts in the comments below.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T17:24:35Z", "url": "https://www.richardson.com/en-gb/blog/achieve-better-sales-results-better-preparation/", "byte_size": 5469, "char_size": 5403}

{"text": "Truth be told I rarely deep fry food. It\u2019s just not how we normally eat in the Boulder Locavore household. Having said that, I end up making a few recipes a year requiring deep frying and my family is always in heaven when I do. I am sure to use lighter, non-GMO oils that perform well at high heat without imparting much flavor to the food. Sunflower oil is my normal go to.\nGluten-Free Churros is on the top of the list. I\u2019m sure any day will be better if I make them (and from the emails and comments I\u2019ve gotten, it seems many gluten-free readers have found the same to be true for them!). Churro Fried Ice Cream is a close second! By the way if you\u2019ve never had fried ice cream, you must try it; cold, creamy ice cream coated with a sweet, hot, fried batter. It\u2019s the best paradox you\u2019ll ever eat!\nCooler weather is coming, football season is almost upon us and I\u2019m careening toward sharing another recipe inspired by our Canadian Maritimes road trip. All paths have led to making Spicy Beer-Battered Onion Rings which are gluten-free!\nSwapping in gluten-free flour for regular flour in the case of battered, deep fried foods seems easy enough. However in my experience, the gluten-free flour density and the type of beer (and even the heat and humidity) does provide flexibility is often needed to get batter just right. I\u2019ll share some notes from my experimentation in the recipe itself but the end result is worth it. Light, crunchy onion rings with a slow after heat from cayenne pepper. They aren\u2019t uber spicy, just enough to catch your attention!\nThough I\u2019ve made these in traditional rings, cutting the onion vertically in wedge-shapes offers the option to make curved onion strips perfect for dipping. The frying process is the same and creates a totally different appetizer. A fun change up for fall entertaining! Deep fried foods are always best hot out of the pot with a few minutes to cool. If made too far in advance they lose the crispy, crunchy effect that makes them so irresistible!\nThere is nothing like deep fried food, even if it\u2019s only an occasional treat! Unfortunately not many such recipes are available to those gluten-free especially with a beer batter. These onions rings were created exclusively with gluten-free flour and gluten-free beer for a slightly spicy, crunchy, irresistible end result!\nWhile developing the recipe I found different GF flour blends and different GF beer can make a difference with the amount of beer required to make a thin batter that is not watery, but not so thick it cannot coat the onion rings easily. The recipe calls for starting with 6 ounces of beer, and based on your ingredients, that may be enough.\nIf not the instructions provide for how to create a batter of perfect thickness regardless of the gluten-free flour blend and beer you choose to use! For a different preparation, instead of cutting the onion into rings, cut the onion through the stem and opposite end.\nPlace the flat, cut side face down on a cutting board and but at an angle into 6 wedges (cutting from the stem to opposite end). Separate the onion, batter the curved pieces and fry as directed below. These will make puffy, dipable onion pieces.\nThere is nothing like deep fried food, even if it's only an occasional treat!\nPour 2-3 inches of oil into a large size heavy pan or pot. Position a cooking thermometer in the oil but not touching the bottom of the pan. Over medium to medium-high heat, heat the oil to 375 degrees.\nSet paper towels on a baking sheet to drain the fried onion rings.\nPlace \u00bd cups of the flour in a large mixing bowl. This will be used to toss the onion rings before battering them.\nIn a large mixing bowl combine the remaining 1 cup gluten-free flour and all the other dry ingredients. Slowly pour in 6 ounces of the beer and whisk to combine allowing the foam to subside. The batter will be thin but not watery. If the batter is too thick to easily dip and coat the onion rings, add 3 ounces more beer; whisk and allow to sit for a few minutes. If it\u2019s still too thick, add the remainder of the beer, whisk to fully combine.\nToss a few onion rings in the flour. Note: the onion rings need room when frying so do not process more at a time than can easily move around when in the hot oil.\nUsing heatproof tongs, dip onion rings individually into the batter, allowing them to be coated fully. Lift coated rings above the batter and allow to drain slightly.\nPlace battered onion rings into the heated oil and cook for a few minutes until they begin to turn golden brown. Remove with tongs or a metal straining tool meant for deep frying and place on prepared paper towels. Repeat for all onion rings. Serve immediately.\nThese photos are making me drool!\nHold amazing onion rings! I haven\u2019t had a homemade one in years, but these look delicious!\nThese onion rings sound super yummy! My family would love them!\nThose look so good. I could go for these right now too!\nI love onion rings, but I rarely fry anything either. My husband would really love these, especially with them being spicy.\nYum, those sound so good. My youngest has a soy allergy, and we\u2019re finding more and more times that things are friend in soybean oil. I\u2019ve got to try this with the sunflower oil.\nThis is one of those recipes that once you make you\u2019ll be asked again and again to make it! Looks so good!\nI\u2019m going to have to make these for my husband! He is such a big fan of anything beer battered and gluten free is a bonus!\nMy husband recently went gluten free and he is having a tough time with things like breading and batters. I will be sharing this yummy recipe with him.\nIt can be a tough transition if your favorite foods aren\u2019t very convertible. I guarantee he\u2019ll never know these don\u2019t have gluten in them!\nThese look fantastic. I\u2019m on a Gluten Free diet so I\u2019m desperate for yummy recipes like these.\nThose sound delicious. I have two good friends that are gluten free and this would be a great thing to make for our bbq night.\nI love onion rings! I will have to try this recipe out! Beer battered sounds tasty!\nThese look so delicious. I love onion rings. I am always looking for new gluten free recipes to try.\nI didn\u2019t know that onion rings had gluten but my husband loves onion rings so I will have to give the recipe a try.\nThe batter for onion rings contains wheat flour normally Beth as well as beer batter would normally be made with regular beer which has gluten (it\u2019s a protein in wheat, barley, rye). My recipe uses both gluten-free flour and gf beer so it\u2019s \u2018safe\u2019 for those gluten-free.\nThank you Debbie! They did turn out fantastic; and I can say that because I ate way more than I should have to be sure!\nThese would be perfect for my boyfriend. Every time we have onion rings he uses this really spicy sauce.\nThese look like really good onion rings. Now my daughter can enjoy onion rings even though she is gluten free.\nGeez, these looks so good! I\u2019m going to have to try and make my own. I\u2019m scared, I won\u2019t stop eating them.\nThese sound and look yummy. I have been cutting out gluten so this is perfect. Thanks for the recipe.\nI know once I got started with these little guys I would not be able to stop \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had spicy onion rings, but it sounds like a brilliant idea!\nI\u2019m reading this while at work and starving. Bad idea as I could go for a bowl right now.\nA bit like grocery shopping when you are hungry? And I suppose pulling out a deep fat frying and whipping up a batch is out of the question!\nThe rings look tasty. Gluten-free is a concept I don\u2019t have to worry about, but I do like the idea of adding spice to the batter. Thanks for the inspiration!\nThese look light as a feather Toni! Good thing you put my rings in one of those bowls to remind me of portion control! It would be hard to stop eating these I\u2019m quite sure.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T09:57:23Z", "url": "https://boulderlocavore.com/spicy-beer-battered-onion-rings-gluten-free-recipe/", "byte_size": 7889, "char_size": 7816}

{"text": "I once had a dog named Bear. He was a bit of a goofball. As with many dogs, he would eat almost anything. However, he developed a particular liking for the flavor of whipped cream. We bought the kind that was pressurized and thus made a particular sound when squirted from the can -- compressed air volumizing the whipped cream, making it fluffy.\nOne time a few months after Bear discovered his love of whipped cream, my mom left the door open when shaving her legs. Bear was in a room nearby, and when my mom started squirting shaving cream from the can, which produced that familiar sound, he came running in and started licking the shaving cream right off her legs.\nHabit learning can be summarized as the \u201cacquisition of associations between stimuli and responses;\u201d that is, our brains learning to associate causes and effects, enhancing certain neural pathways. To simplify things, let\u2019s just say the brain builds \u201croads\u201d between various memories, and the more these roads are travelled the easier they become to travel. The more you think something, the easier it is to think it again.6 This happens regardless of why you thought something or if it is correct or incorrect. For instance, being in a bad mood can cause us to have different morals than we\u2019d have when in a good mood.7 From the \u201cbad mood\u201d nodes of our brain, the easiest roads to travel are often those with \u201cbad\u201d morals.\nFurthermore, once these paths are created, our subconscious travels them whether we like it or not. They may even form new paths without us knowing -- shortcuts to feelings whose origins are then forgotten, the result of countless choices that we made sometime in the past.8 (I once had a friend who trimmed her nails to calm herself down. She picked up the habit by being calm, then trimming her nails). Even our emotions can manifest as these \u201cunconscious habits.\u201d 9 Let me say that again: our emotions can be habits whose origins we\u2019ve forgotten.\nNegative habits can compound themselves by leading to other negative habits, and pretty soon, you\u2019re on a downward spiral with no roads out (literally -- as long as \u201croad\u201d is synonymous with \u201cneural pathway,\u201d of course). When most of your thoughts are negative, you might exhibit symptoms of depression. When most of your thoughts are fearful, you might exhibit symptoms of anxiety.\nReplacing the destination of a well-traveled road can be effective as well (we might call this the \u201cbait and switch\u201d).14 For instance, one of the reasons video games are so appealing is because they provide social interaction combined with a challenge. These are both legitimate psychological needs, but it might be that video games aren\u2019t satisfying anymore. We can\u2019t simply replace them with reading a book -- reading isn\u2019t typically either social or challenging -- but we might replace it with a sport. When your brain feels the need for a challenging social activity, it will think video games. But before long, you can have it thinking soccer, and all the associated thoughts along with your new favorite sport.\nHabits are both physical as well as mental. Our brain learns from what we think -- consciously or subconsciously -- but we can build new roads for it to travel. Roads that lead to positive thought.\nJust don\u2019t get confused between the whipped cream and the shaving cream.\n1A. Earling, The Tetris Effect: Do computer games fry your brain?

By scanning electron microscopy and image analysis, the mean orientation of mineral platelets at the osteoblastic\u2013osteocyte lacuna (Ot.Lc) floor was found to be 19\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 in the tibia and 20\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 in the femur. Further, the mineral platelets showed a high degree of directional coherency: 37 \u00b1 7 % in the tibia and 38 \u00b1 9 % in the femur. The majority of Ot.Lc in the tibia (69.37 %) and the femur (74.77 %) exhibited a mean orientation of mineral platelets between 0\u00b0 and 25\u00b0, with the largest fraction within a 15\u00b0\u201320\u00b0 range, 17.12 and 19.8 % in the tibia and femur, respectively. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterise the features observed on the anorganic bone surface. The Ca/P (atomic %) ratio was 1.69 \u00b1 0.1 within the Ot.Lc and 1.68 \u00b1 0.1 externally. Raman spectra of NaOCl-treated bone showed peaks associated with carbonated apatite: \u03bd1, \u03bd2 and \u03bd4 PO4 3\u2212, and \u03bd1 CO3 2\u2212, while the collagen amide bands were greatly reduced in intensity compared to untreated bone. The apatite-to-collagen ratio increased considerably after deproteinisation; however, the mineral crystallinity and the carbonate-to-phosphate ratios were unaffected. The ~19\u00b0\u201320\u00b0 orientation of mineral platelets in at the Ot.Lc floor may be attributable to a gradual rotation of osteoblasts in successive layers relative to the underlying surface, giving rise to the twisted plywood-like pattern of lamellar bone.\nThe online version of this article (doi: 10.1007/s00223-015-0072-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorised users.\nThis study was supported by the Swedish Research Council (Grant K2015-52X-09495-28-4), the BIOMATCELL VINN Excellence Center of Biomaterials and Cell Therapy, the Region V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland, an ALF/LUA Grant, the IngaBritt and Arne Lundberg Foundation, the Dr. Felix Neubergh Foundation, Promobilia, the Hjalmar Svensson Foundation, and the Materials Science Area of Advance at Chalmers and the Department of Biomaterials, University of Gothenburg.\nFurqan A.

{"text": "The name of the file can be arbitrary but must have the .lektorproject extension or Lektor will not be able to find it. When Lektor looks for a project it looks upwards from the current folder until it finds a single file with the .lektorproject extension and that's then the root of the project.\nIt's possible to build a Lektor project in the absence of a Project file, but this usage is heavily discouraged. It exists primarily for quick testing situations. But don't be confused if you encounter a Lektor project that does not come with a corresponding project file.\nThis is the human readable name of the project. It's used in various places where the system wants to show the context of the operations. For instance the admin panel will display this to indicate which project is being worked on.\nThis is the default locale of the website. This defaults to en_US and can be changed to many others. Most locales of the CLDR project are supported. This information is for instance used to format dates.\nThis is the full URL of the website. If set this information can be used to enable the external URL generation parameter. Lektor tries hard to make websites work in a way where this information is not necessary but some systems might need it. For instance sitemaps require full URLs and not having them would be a violation of the specification.\nrelative URLs are generated relative to the currently active page.\nexternal URLs are generated with the fully canonical URL (external).\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to all styles. relative has the benefit that it works without any configuration no matter where you deploy to. The downside is that you cannot have a page appear on multiple paths which for instance breaks custom error pages. absolute is useful for situations where you have custom error pages and you generally know a bit about the server you are deploying to. external generally makes not a lot of sense as default setting but exists for consistency's sake.\nFor individual URLs that are generated with the url_to function it's possible to override the default URL style.\nIf this is not set (which is the default) then Lektor will find the content files right next to the project file. However in some situations you might want to move a project file to a completely different location for instance because you want to have settings in there that you do not want to put into version control. In that case you can set the path in the file to a path (absolute or relative to the project file) which resolves to the project tree.\nNote that if this setting is used some functionality in the desktop app might no longer work (for instance opening .lr files with a double click).\nA list of file names or Unix shell-style wildcards, separated by commas. The wildcard syntax follows fnmatch.\nBy default, filenames beginning with \"_\" or \".\" are not copied from the assets directory to the output directory. Exclude additional files with the excluded_assets option.\nA comma-separated list of file names or Unix shell-style wildcards, specifying files that should be copied from the assets directory to the output directory even if they begin with \"_\" or \".\" (the default exclusion patterns) or match your custom excluded_assets pattern. The wildcard syntax follows fnmatch.\nThis section controls the packages (plugins) that should be installed for this project. It's a simple key/value list where the key is the plugin name and the value is the version number.\nThe target URL for the server. This URL is specific to the deployment method that is being used. For a list of which URLs are supported refer to the deployment guides.\nThis setting can be used to enable/disable the server. The default is yes.\nThis can be used to set a server to be used by default. If only one server is configured it's an implicit default.\nThis configures Alternatives. It is repeated for each intended alternative. The default behavior is that alternatives are disabled.\nThe human readable name for the alternative. The admin interface uses this.\nA prefix that is added in front of all URLs to identify this alternative.\nA suffix that is added behind all URLs to enable this alternative.

{"text": "Real Madrid is possibly the most world renowned football club. On 11 December 2000, at its annual gala, FIFA granted the title of team of the 20th century to Real Madrid.

The Madrid is not the oldest football in the world club, or even Spain (that honor belongs to Recreativo de Huelva) and has no Stadium with greater capacity, or the largest number of partners. But, by any part of the world, the mere mention of those two words, Real Madrid, is enough: there is no person who knows anything of football who are not familiar with that name.

All of them have defended the coat of arms of the club which has caused greater impression in the world of football.\nBut they are not only players, both past and present, that make the great institution that is Real Madrid. Triumphs in Spain and Europe, make the club trophy room the most prestigious in the world. Real Madrid has won more European cups, the European club competition for excellence, than any other team. And in the League, he has no equal. Much of all these triumphs are due to the vision of one man.

Strawberry Jam is one of the easiest jams to make and is almost fool-proof.\nI would love to have a strawberry bed in the near future but for now I have bought mine. So in about 1 hour 30 minutes, I made enough jam to feed my family for the rest of the year.

This is one whole jar of powdered pectin. 1 to 2 tablespoons butter if needed to reduce foaming.\nYou will need 8 half pint jars ( we call them jelly jars) with lids and rings I always get two extra ready also. A boiling water canner with enough boiling water to cover the tops of you jars with 1 to 2 inches of water.You will need a potato masher to make the crushed fruit, a jar lifter, funnel and a ladle. One large dutch oven or stock pot for cooking the jam in. I like to wear rubber gloves to protect my hands from the boiling hot jam but you can skip it if you are careful.\nAfter washing jars lids and rings, sterilize the jars either in the microwave or in the boiling water of the canner. I boil my lids and rings separately in a small sauce pan that I keep very hot until ready to us. Remove from sterile jars from canner or microwave and place on a towel to cool and dry.\nIn large stock pot add the 2 quarts of smashed berries, lemon juice and classic pectin mix together well. Bring to a boil, stirring to keep from scorching. Add sugar to pot and stir until sugar dissolved. Return to a rolling boil, one that will not stop when stirred. Boil one minute stirring constantly. Remove from heat add one teaspoon of butter if jam is foamy on top. Mix in well and skim top of Jam to remove foamy skin. Ladle hot jam into clean jars leaving about 1/4 of inch of headspace.Be careful to not to burn yourself on hot syrup. Clean top rim of jar to remove any leftover fruit or juice adding lid and adjust ring. Process 10 minutes in boiling water canner. Remove from hot water and let completely cool check rings and tighten if needed and store for up to one year.\nJars loaded into canner to process 10 minutes. No pressure needed.\nIn the end I finished the morning with 9 half pint jars of jam and still had a few strawberries left over for strawberry rhubarb jam also. I grow rhubarb so I made a small batch of Jam with the leftover berries and three stalks of rhubarb.They all tasted great and will keep us thinking of summer all winter long.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T02:04:06Z", "url": "https://westvirginiamountainmama.com/tag/jam/", "byte_size": 3051, "char_size": 3051}

{"text": "DENMARK - UK \u2013 ASIA - EUROPE \u2013 In a bold move designed to out manoeuvre their rivals Maersk, the largest container shipping line in the world, today announced what they consider to be the first major step forward in box transportation for well over a decade. \u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 will offer guaranteed delivery times from four Asian ports to three major European hubs for any FCL freight deliveries every day of the week.\nSpeaking at the London launch Eivind Kolding, CEO Maersk Line said that from the company's inception in 1928 very little changed from the monthly schedules offered until in the late 1940\u2019s when twice monthly services appeared. Even with the introduction of containerisation weekly schedules failed to appear until the 1990\u2019s since when little if anything had changed. He said it was Maersk\u2019s intention to offer shippers a \u2018conveyor belt\u2019 service with Maersk becoming a natural extension of a supplier\u2019s production line.\nThe service schedules were arrived at after Maersk embarked on a protracted dialogue with their major customers and indeed the product is principally aimed at the heavy hitters, the regular clients with extensive contract commitments to shipping large quantities, which is not to say that spot purchase clients will not necessarily benefit from the reduced delivery times Maersk feel are attainable.\nThe discussion with stakeholders produced three clear requirements including reliability, all shippers were keen to know exactly when their goods would arrive at the destination port as currently around 50% of TEU\u2019s fail to meet the original estimated times of arrival. Complicated systems were another bugbear, consignors wanted a one stop, one touch system rather than the nineteen or so inputs required to send a box on its way which currently exists. The third request was to ensure that wherever possible the customer could claim to maintain their green credentials by utilising a system that was as clean as could reasonably be expected.\n\u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 is the product of these discussions and Maersk are so confident of its success they are to pay compensation for every container that fails to meet the deadline they have underwritten. The company will pay customers who sign up to the system compensation of $100 for a delay between one and three days. Should the freight arrive 4 days late they will hand over $300. Needless to say Maersk have written in get out clauses for bad weather, port strikes etc.\nOf course there is a downside, at present up to 50% of booked boxes fail to arrive at the port in time to meet the cut off times, or indeed at all, and to the container companies this simply means lost revenue. Containers booked under the new system which fail to arrive will be subject to a penalty which presumably will be negotiated with individual shippers (those which deign to agree to it). Maersk see this system as a way to directly influence the current overbooking problem.\nThe new schedules, from Ningbo, Shanghai, Yantian and Tanjung Pelepas to Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam, will occupy 70 vessels of the company\u2019s fleet, around 25% of Maersk Line\u2019s TEU carrying capacity. Despite the mention of the intent to make the service as green as possible it simply may not be feasible with traffic levels as they are. Only by running the newer, larger yet more efficient vessels closer to their full capacity can reduced emissions of CO2 per tonne be achieved. To ensure vessels make their guaranteed time targets it may even be sometimes necessary to abandon the current slow steaming policy, designed to conserve expensive fuel and reduce pollution levels, simply to stick to schedules.\n\u201cThis is the first time compensation will be paid by a shipping company and this is to underscore our confidence in this product. We have been in discussion with a number of customers, including Sony, and they have expressed approval. \u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 responds to some key concerns by ensuring on time delivery in Northern Europe. How can we do this? By upping capacity and spreading port calls and having a back up plan for every vessel. All the customer needs is total transport. We see larger customers with sophisticated management systems taking advantage of this and reducing their warehousing needs.\nNo partnerships with other lines will be involved in the provision of this service and, before anyone believes this will be rolled out globally, even Maersk admit that the daily cut off system is currently only feasible on the busy Asia to Europe run. Cynics will note that Maersk are due to collect a lot more of the bigger container vessels they have on order within the next year or two and they need cargo to fill them but there is no doubt that other box carriers will feel a chill down their spines at what is a very inventive and bold move to completely dominate the Asian European freight trade.\nThe first daily cut off will be on the 24th October, the guaranteed transportation times to the three European ports (Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam) are as follows. Ex Ningbo \u2013 36 days, ex Shanghai \u2013 34 days, ex Yantian \u2013 30 days and for Tanjung Pelepas \u2013 26 days. Transportation time is defined as from the cut off date issued for the departure port and the availability of the cargo at the port of destination. If cargo arrives early there will be no demurrage charges until the agreed cargo availability date has passed.\nAround seven million forty foot equivalent units pass from Asia to Northern Europe annually and Maersk currently shift over one million of them. With this set of schedules it is obvious that the Danish giants intend to take up as much of the market as possible by concentrating more than ever on the companies responsible for the bulk of this traffic. The end result remains to be seen but as this scheme takes shape at least two of Maersk\u2019s main rivals will be looked at very closely by industry analysts should it result in an upswing of tonnage for \u2018Daily Maersk\u2019.\nPhoto:- The giant Emma Maersk in port.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T09:45:12Z", "url": "http://www.handyshippingguide.com/shipping-news/container-freight-undergoes-a-facelift-with-guaranteed-daily-service_3067", "byte_size": 6051, "char_size": 6001}

{"text": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T15:06:59Z", "url": "https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1093161_electric-motorcycle-road-trip-what-i-learned-what-you-need-to-know", "byte_size": 5855, "char_size": 5855}

{"text": "Binance Coin is way ahead of other cryptocurrencies for price growth so far in 2019.\nAs we approach Spring 2019, BNB has been the only coin out of the Dirty Dozen to rally to price levels from before 2018\u2019s winter in equities and crypto prices.\nThe Dirty Dozen are the twelve relatively mature cryptocurrencies that currently have a $1M+ market cap and a lot of circulating volume- so they flow through many hands.\nThere will be more than a dozen again soon enough as many more private currencies swell in capitalization to the $1M+ threshold. But the current roster is: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, Binance Coin, Stellar, Tether, TRON, Cardano, and Bitcoin SV.\nOf these 12 most highly capitalized cryptocurrencies BNB currently comprises 1.8% of the total market capitalization, ranking Binance Coin seventh out of all cryptocurrencies globally in order of market cap size, behind Bitcoin Cash and ahead of Stellar.\nTRON Founder and CEO Justin Sun says Binance Coin is another Bitcoin.\nBitcoin- to which Binance Coin has been compared recently on its remarkable run ahead of the rest of the pack (e.g. Binance coin is \u201cthe next Bitcoin,\u201d as TRON Founder and CEO Justin Sun has averred)- comprises 60% of the Dirty Dozen\u2019s total market capitalization.\nSo notwithstanding the assessment of the venerable TRON Founder, and owner of BitTorrent who did after all just make $2.8M worth of BNB for an offering of 23.7M BTT in January, Binance Coin would have a way to go before it\u2019s the next Bitcoin.\nLitecoin is appreciating very well in 2019, but its price gains are nothing like Binance Coin\u2019s 2019 liftoff.\nThe only other major, older coin to shake off the frost from 2018\u2019s crypto winter and warm up to a spring price breakout anything like Binance Coin\u2019s is Litecoin.\nLitecoin is the 2011 fork of the Bitcoin core software implementation to create a coin with similar properties to Bitcoin, but which processes new blocks every 2.5 minutes instead of every 10 minutes, and which uses the more computationally-intensive Scrypt for proof of work hashes instead of SHA-256 like Bitcoin.\nThe altcoin has been described as the digital equivalent of silver to Bitcoin\u2019s status as the digital equivalent of gold. Its advantages are lower transaction fees than bitcoin, and shorter average transaction confirmation time.\nUntil ASICs were updated in the never ending mining arms race to be Scrypt capable, Litecoin also created interest for people with CPUs who could not compete with these Application Specific Integrated Circuits.\nScrypt requires proof your RAM worked too, briefly shutting out the ASIC computational artillery designed for the sole purpose of performing hashes and mining bitcoin.\nAs the next halvening of the miners\u2019 Litecoin reward in August 2019 approaches, crypto investors are filling their saddles with Litecoin. But digital silver still has a ways left to reach its pre-2018 crypto winter valuations like liquid coin for ICO investments have.\nA Binance Launchpad ICO boom is giving Binance Coin\u2019s price a massive rocket boost.\nOn January 28 the BitTorrent Token (BTT) ICO, which sold 59.4 billion BTT for around $7 million (at a price roughly equivalent to $0.00012 USD for 1 BTT), sold out in under 15 minutes for both BTT/BNB and BTT/TRX sessions.\nThe sale happened so fast people complained that they were unable to make a purchase of BTT at the time of the ICO within minutes of the coin offering opening.\nAlthough all transactions cleared with coins in their new owners\u2019 accounts in under 15 minutes for both sessions, Binance CEO C.Z. says if he had used more computer power to process requests the $7 million BTT ICO could have been completed in ten seconds.\nIt was over in a about 10 seconds. The queue was totally packed within seconds. The processing is just draining the queue slowly. Congrats to @fetch_ai !\nSince February 25, the price of BTT has settled into a very stable $0.00074496 USD / 1 BTT for a cool 521% return on the initial investment for those who traded their BNB or TRON for BTT. Even with its meteoric rise since BTT\u2019s Jan 28th ICO, Binance Coin\u2019s 160% price increase was still no match for the file sharing giant\u2019s token hot off its ICO.\nFar vaster profits were made by those who sold their BitTorrent Tokens in February when 1 BTT could fetch four Lincoln pennies before the price settled to its current level.\nSince then another Binance Launchpad-powered ICO, for Fetch.AI, fetched $6 million for the coin\u2019s developers in 22 seconds over Binance.\nFetch.AI tokens debuted at a price of 0.008584 BNB / 1 FET, and will currently fetch back .01448 BNB for every 1 Fetch.AI token investors bought.\nThe next Binance Launchpad ICO will be on March 19th for Celer.\nFor risk tolerant day traders who\u2019ve been following along closely with crypto and ICOs seeking short term opportunities for high rewards, the ability to make those kind of returns on a speculative investment in promising new cryptocurrencies is throwing fuel on the fire of the raging demand for BNB that Binance has so methodically built.\nDespite the crypto community\u2019s (albeit in many cases rather compelling) disparagement of the ICO bubble- which accumulated its fair share of well-deserved criticisms throughout 2017 and 2018, along with massive infusions of capital for the coins\u2019 creators and huge profits for some very well-funded, highly-organized speculators, who know what they\u2019re doing- crypto investors continue to have a relentless appetite for ICOs in 2019.\nAlong with providing liquidity and discounted fees for trades among the 171 cryptos currently exchanged on Binance, BNB Coin seems to be well assured of trading strong throughout 2019, buoyed by investor demand for bits of the tech businesses knocking on Binance\u2019s door, massive user base and a sensible use case for tokenization in tow.\nDisclaimer: The author owns BNB Coin, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies. He holds investment positions in the coins, but does not engage in short-term or day-trading.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T04:32:55Z", "url": "https://hacked.com/the-long-term-bullish-case-for-binance-coin-bnb/", "byte_size": 6052, "char_size": 6010}

{"text": "Our existence is not in isolation with the rest of the world. While this idea sounds spiritual, it is very pertinent to social and global situations that we see every now and then. When a house is on fire in the neighborhood, if we don\u2019t act, it is only a matter of time before the fire reaches our own doorstep.\nThere is an idea found in many ancient cultures that this world is one organism. The microcosm is a reflection of the macrocosm. Just like within us there are billions of cells with their independent existence that collectively make up our existence, all the billions of people and other creatures make up the Being of this world.\nToday, there are many parts of the world that are on fire. Many governments and authorities, like in Syria and Egypt, end up using force in conflict-zones. While sometimes necessary in extreme situations, such an approach is reactive and often leads to complications in the long term. Taking care of hygiene and preserving health is easier than to go through treatment after the onset of disease. Just as we need to be proactive in maintaining our health, we need to be proactive in maintaining harmony in the world. A healthy multi-cultural exposure to children can go a long way in eliminating religious fanaticism. An attitude of service cultivated in young minds can be a preventive approach to tackling corruption. Therefore, proper education \u2013 one that inculcates human values and honors diversity, is necessary for sustainable peace in the world.\nOnly a few people in the world cause terror, not the whole population. Of the seven billion people on this planet, there are hardly a few thousand who cause crime and the whole world is affected. With the same law, won\u2019t the reverse also work? Just a few thousand of us, being really peaceful, loving and caring for the whole planet \u2014 can we not bring a transformation? One should not think, \u2018What can I do?\u201d or that one is insignificant. Everyone has a role to play when the world is in turmoil. A tiny homeopathic pill has the power to heal an 80 kg body. In the same way, every individual has an influence on this cosmos, on this planet.\nWhen we radiate peace and good vibrations, it definitely makes an impact. Those of us who have been fortunate to find some peace within ourselves, now have a challenge to reach out to all those who are not at peace with themselves as well as to those countries and parts of the world where there is conflict. The knowledge of the oneness that we share with the world can bring people out of their narrow mindsets. A bigger vision of life can kindle human values, enabling one to see diversity in oneness and unity in diversity.\nNew York: We have known it for ages. Now Americans have woken up to the benefits meditation brings in life.\nMeditations have different effects and that meditation can lead to non-dual or transcendental experiences \u2013 a sense of self-awareness without content, says a fascinating study.\nAccording to Fred Travis, director of the centre for brain, consciousness, and cognition at Maharishi University of Management in the US, physiological measures and first-person descriptions of transcendental experiences and higher states have only been investigated during practice of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique.\nAfter analyzing descriptions of transcendental consciousness from 52 people practicing TM, Travis found that they experienced \u201ca state where thinking, feeling, and individual intention were missing, but self-awareness remained\u201d.\nA systematic analysis of their experiences revealed three themes \u2013 absence of time, space and body sense.\n\u201cThis research focuses on the larger purpose of meditation practices \u2013 to develop higher states of consciousness,\u201d explained Travis.\nWith regular meditation, experiences of transcendental consciousness begin to co-exist with sleeping, dreaming and even while one is awake.\nThis state is called cosmic consciousness in the Vedic tradition, said the paper published in the journal Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.\nWhereas people practicing TM describe themselves in relation to concrete cognitive and behavioral processes, those experiencing cosmic consciousness describe themselves in terms of a continuum of inner self-awareness that underlies their thoughts, feelings and actions, added the paper.\n\u201cThe practical benefit of higher states is that you become more anchored to your inner self, and, therefore, less likely to be overwhelmed by the vicissitudes of daily life,\u201d said Travis.\nTM is an effortless technique for automatic self-transcending, different from the other categories of meditation \u2013 focused attention or open monitoring.\nIt allows the mind to settle inward beyond thought to experience the source of thought \u2013 pure awareness or transcendental consciousness.\nThis is the most silent and peaceful level of consciousness \u2013 one\u2019s innermost self, said the study.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T08:47:19Z", "url": "http://www.nripulse.com/the-world-is-one-organism/", "byte_size": 4944, "char_size": 4906}

She had had a paralytic attack and yet she was very active. My mother remembers how she was very specific in the steps involved in making this dish. She had the use of one hand and we remember how she still could manage to demonstrate the making of the pomfret in a creamy coconut sauce. The pomfrets have to be cut in a specific manner, the addition of the ingredients has to be timed perfectly and most importantly all the prepped ingredients have to be available at hand to add at the proper time. In order to get the proper consistency one cannot stop in between. The resultant preparation is finger-licking delicious and goes well with steamed rice.\nVinegar \u2013 3 to 4 tsp.\nStep 1: Grind the ingredients for the spiced coconut milk using 1 cup warm water to a fine paste. Sieve using a fine mesh strainer to get the 1st extract (thick milk) and leave aside. Grind the coconut residue with 1 \u00bd cup warm water and extract the thin coconut milk.\nStep 3: Whisk the egg and discard half of the whisked egg. Beat the remaining whisked egg with 3 to 4 tsp. of palm vinegar and sugar till the sugar dissolves. The resultant mixture should appear homogeneous and watery.\nStep 4: Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onions on medium heat till soft. Add the chopped garlic and ginger. Cover and cook on low heat for 2 minutes. Add the chopped tomato and \u00bc of the chopped green chillies and cook covered on low heat for a further 2 minutes.\nStep 5: Put off the heat and leave covered for 5 minutes. We do not want to brown the tomato but we will cook the tomato in the trapped heat till it is soft and cooked.\nStep 6: Re-strain the thin coconut milk and add to the pan with \u00bd tsp. salt and bring to a boil on medium heat. Next add the fish. Hold the sides of the pan and swirl the pan to coat the fish and distribute it evenly in the pan. Do not use a spoon. Cover and cook on low heat for 4 minutes.\nStep 7: Add the remaining green chillies and re-strain the thick coconut milk into the pan. Cook uncovered on low heat for 2 minutes. Add the egg-sugar-vinegar mixture to the pan and swirl the pan holding its sides. Cook further for 1 \u00bd minutes.

{"text": "We spoke previously on the management of privileged accounts and how important it is to keep them accountable. Privileged accounts are one of many different types of accounts that should fall under your organizations Account Management Program and another one to add to that would be service accounts.\nWhat is a service account anyway? In basic terms, a service account is an account that a service on your computer uses to run under and access resources. This should not be a user\u2019s personal account. While they may look the same, the separation of users from services is very important for both tracking and the ability to tighten down what an account can and cannot do. A service account could also be an account that is used for a scheduled task (sometimes referred to as a batch job account), or an account that is used in a script that is run outside of a specific user\u2019s context. A scheduled task account should not be a personal user\u2019s account for the same reasons that a service should not run under a personal user\u2019s account.\nYou may ask what is so important about these? It seems like if it is not a user account, then how would it have access to my organization\u2019s network? On the contrary, these accounts are a favorite target of many malicious actors because they are often implemented in such a way that they have a higher level of access than a user account. Historically, they also have not changed passwords as often (if ever) as user accounts.\nServices are often installed under the built-in Local System account, which gives what are essentially local administrator privileges, so they are more predictable in how they will be able to be used if compromised. While local administrator privileges may seem somewhat harmless since they are not usually useable on other computers on your network, the local administrator privileges can end up granting access to domain username/password combinations and or lead to account changes that allow for easier connections to other parts of your network. As a result, both locking down a service account and following good password change and audit procedures is an important part of keeping your systems secure.\nWhen it comes to the configuration and management of service accounts, there a few things listed below that can help.\nPassword Management \u2013 Some administrators like to set these accounts up with passwords that do not expire or use the same password for all the service accounts. Instead, there needs to be a strategy for managing these passwords and changing them on a regular basis, as well as using unique passwords.\nPrivilege Management \u2013 It is best practice to implement the principle of least privilege. Only provide the minimum necessary privileges to service accounts. If your service account must run with administrative privileges, deny that account access to all of the directories besides the one or two that it needs.\nNaming \u2013 Consider names that are not completely obvious to the service, for example SQLService would be helpful to administrators, but it is more helpful to attackers. While obfuscation is not usually a recommendation to secure systems, in this case it may slow someone down enough to not want to try every account available.\nAuditing \u2013 Logging and auditing of service accounts, and all accounts in any case, is very important to keep systems secure. Using an event log aggregator and looking for specific events can be helpful in discovering security problems and services that are not working correctly.\nLocking down your service accounts should be a basic component of your hardening guide for all computers. While it requires more time to lock down a new service account to allow access only to what it needs, it is well worth the time spent. Defense-in-depth requires that you look at more than the perimeter, and service accounts are one major place where the in-depth strategy can serve you well.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T20:50:13Z", "url": "https://www.securit360.com/blog/best-practices-privileged-account-management-part-2/", "byte_size": 3922, "char_size": 3904}

{"text": "Securing Event Sponsorship: What are sponsors looking for and how do you deliver it.\nFrom the music industry to sports and everything in between- I\u2019ve had the opportunity to help others create, build, organize, and plan events on multiple levels\u2026.BUT, if there is one essential EVERY Event Organizer wants, it\u2019s SPONSORSHIP.\nWith over 8 years of experience in event planning, promotion, marketing, PR, and so on, I can honestly say it wasn\u2019t until maybe 2 years ago that I fully understood exactly how event sponsorship works. With that being said, I\u2019ve decided to write this blog and share my knowledge and insight that I\u2019ve gained over the years \u2013 to better help you understand what it takes to secure sponsorship, what sponsors are looking for, and how to deliver what they want.\nSPONSORS: WHY DO THEY SPONSOR? AND WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR IN SPONSORSHIP?\nEvent Sponsorship is the act of a person and/or company giving support to an event through the provision of products, services, or monetarily \u2013 with an expectation of their business goals/agenda being met, primarily by reaching their target audience.\nIn recent years, event sponsorship has been the fastest growing marketing strategy for companies seeking to leverage their brand \u2013 increasingly enough that in 2017, according to IEG Sponsorship- it recorded 24.2 billion in sponsorship spending from companies in North America. What exactly does this mean?? It means there is plenty of money out there, and companies are ready to spend it! So how do you attract the right sponsors and secure the sponsorship?\nKnowing your demographic audience is invaluable \u2013 this is an essential that sponsors want to know and that will need to go in your sponsor deck. What is it to know your demographic? Age, gender, nationality, income level, education level, etc. The more in-depth you can go with this information, the easier it will be to secure the \u201cright sponsors\u201d. *Side Note* Before companies sponsor, they need to know their marketing dollars are going directly to their targeted audience.\nDevelop a captivating sponsorship deck \u2013 Your sponsorship deck, from graphics to content curation is going to say everything about your event without speaking a word. It\u2019s the first thing sponsors see (first impression is the last impression, so make it presentable.) What info goes in your sponsorship deck? 1. ABOUT YOUR EVENT- be sure to state your mission and invite them to support your cause. 2. BENEFITS OF SPONSORSHIP \u2013 although I like to create personal proposals for companies according to their business objectives, it\u2019s always good to start out with a generic one. BE CREATIVE when doing this. Think as if your that company, what would you want from sponsoring an event? 3. DEMOGRAHICS \u2013 Sponsors want to know how many people attend your events and the demographics of attendee to see if it aligns with the market they are trying reach 4. Include a fact page about your event: Number of attendees, previous sponsors, press coverage links, notable people that attended, photos (photos of crowd, fan interaction, celebrities, sponsors, anything that would attract a current sponsor.) 5. Contact info and logo. Be sure full name, email, phone number, website, and social media sites.\nDELIVER, DELIVER, DELIVER \u2013 Whatever it is that you said you were going to do, DO IT!! This is so important in building your relationship with the sponsor. You want them to be overly satisfied, that they have received their ROI (Return on Investment). Find out what they liked, or didn\u2019t like, or maybe what could be done a little differently. This allows you to possibly continue your relationship for the following year.\nThe key to successfully securing event sponsorship is taking into consideration the needs of your sponsors and developing creative strategies that help them obtain their business goals. In turn, adding value to your event \u2013 delivering the ultimate experience to your customers.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T20:49:01Z", "url": "https://ninazavalagroup.blog/tag/business/", "byte_size": 3979, "char_size": 3939}

MIL has proven herself unable to bite her tongue when it comes to sharing our special news.\nMy SIL did this to us when DD was born. I was raging then and it still upsets me when I think about it. I know she only did it because she was so excited for us but it's still totally unacceptable to me.\nI hate the thought of it. My sister was really unwell after her bub was born (spent 2 nights in ICU) and I didn't mention anything on FB even though I was so proud and excited. I wasn't FB friends with my BIL at that time (he has general family issues, more with his but long story) and I ended up texting my sister a few days later to ask if there were anymore photos (they live interstate) and all mum dad and I had seen was one photo from immediately after the birth. BIL had made the announcement on FB when he was born and had been sharing all these photos with his friends, but none with us. I don't know what my sister had done, but she wasn't tagged in any of the announcements/photos so we were literally in the dark, so that sucked. I was happy I waited until I knew they had announced it, but also annoyed at the fact that more of the news/photos were shared amongst his friends only. I'd do the same again though. Not my baby, not my news.\nThis however is my biggest worry when we have babies. My MIL puts everything on Facebook, there is no filter. It's like there's no thought about whether appropriate or not. (Her breast cancer diagnosis was played out on Facebook. Basically the second she was off the phone with us telling us she had announced it on FB \ud83d\ude15) She will be someone I'm wary of and I shouldn't have to be.\nMy friend had her baby in July. Her best friend announced it. And people congratulated her before she got a word in. I asked her and she said she didn't mind. Evidently it depends on the parent.\nBut in my personal opinion. Not ok in any circumstances.\nWhen I had DS1 my father put it on Facebook within minutes of me calling. That's how my BFF (babies godmother) found out. I was planning on calling her within an hour or so when we had decided bubs name. I was furious.\nWith ds2 my BFF received the first phone call and my father the last. People were told \"we're holding off posting in Facebook until we confirm bubs name.\"\nIt happened to us and I was so upset. We had a beautifully worded announcement ready that was spoilt by a family member jumping the gun. This family member had my phone number so could have text a congrats. I deleted the msg as soon as I saw it but a few people had already responded.\nWe wanted to wait till the next day to Facebook announce so we could enjoy the special time to ourselves for a while.\nI think it's so rude.\nYeah it wouldn't really bother me. I know some people actually disable their account from a week out from their due date so they aren't bombarded and can concentrate on the impending birth.\nSlightly different but my MIL announced when we found out I was pregnant on Facebook. I was only 10 weeks, so I was really annoyed!\nIt was our news to share and she took that away from us.

The Carolina Hurricanes have drawn the first wildcard spot and will face the Metropolitan Division-leading Washington Capitals in the first round of the playoffs. The New York Islanders will be the second seed in the Metro and will have to square off against the Pittsburgh Penguins. In the Atlantic Division, the Columbus Blue Jackets end up with a tough match-up as they will face the Tampa Bay Lightning, while the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs will meet once again, as everyone has known about for quite some time. The final results of the night will determine how the Western Conference Shakes out.\nThe Colorado Avalanche\u2019s Mikko Rantanen was spotted on the ice Saturday in San Jose wearing a non-contact jersey, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The injured forward, who hasn\u2019t seen action since March 21st with an undisclosed injury, traveled with the team but will sit out once again. While that doesn\u2019t sound like great news, considering the playoffs are right around the corner it is better to have him skating than not. If Colorado has any chance of advancing out of the first round, they will need their young scorer. The 22-year-old will have played eight less games than last year, but has a career high 31 goals and 87 points in his sophomore season. Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar said later today that he is hopeful that Rantanen will be available for the playoffs, according to BSN\u2019s Adrian Dater.\nSpeaking of injuries, the Pittsburgh Penguins got some good news as defenseman Brian Dumoulin skated on his own after missing the past three games with a lower-body injury, according to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Dumoulin, who normally skates alongside Kris Letang, would make a big impact on a lineup that is preparing for the playoffs and could use the player tied for fifth in the NHL with a +31 rating. \u201cThe fact that Dumo is on the ice is really encouraging from our standpoint,\u201d Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. He added that the injury isn\u2019t considered major and Doumolin remains day-to-day.\nThe St. Louis Blues expect to get back defenseman Colton Parayko, who has sat out the past two games with an undisclosed injury. The 25-year-old defender is expected to play in the playoffs, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u2019s Jim Thomas. Thomas added that Tyler Bozak was just held out for precautionary reasons Saturday after he was in a car accident getting to the game. The veteran center was rear-ended, but wasn\u2019t seriously hurt. He too is expected back for the playoff opener.\nAs the Blackhawks pass through another disappointing season, the team must continue to focus on development. The team has a nice group of prospects coming up the pipeline, but there are many that are starting to worry about whether the Blackhawks are doing the right thing with defenseman Henri Jokiharju, their 2017 first-rounder.\nThe Blackhawks, not known for developing defensemen recently, loaned Jokiharju out to Finland for the World Junior Championships, against the youngster\u2019s wishes even though they eventually won the gold medal. Since his return, the team has changed course in his development, moving him over to the left side, his off-side which will help make room next season for right-hand shot Adam Boqvist, and has had his ice-time cut, according to The Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required). He even was a healthy scratch recently.\nHead coach Jeremy Colliton said the changes are being made to make sure the youngster won\u2019t burn out like many rookies do during their first season.\nThe Colorado Avalanche suffered a key loss Saturday as the team will be without defenseman Erik Johnson, who suffered a concussion during their game against Los Angeles. The veteran defenseman is expected to be out for the next two games and head coach Jared Bednar hopes he\u2019ll be back after the All-Star break, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The defensive-minded blueliner averages 21:42 of ATOI and is a key figure on the team\u2019s defense.\nThe Avalanche also had good news in practice as defensive prospect Conor Timmins, who has missed all of the 2018-19 season so far with a concussion, practiced today with the team even if it was in a non-contact jersey, according to BSN\u2019s AJ Haefele. Bednar said after the practice that Timmins will begin ramping up activities over the next couple of weeks and they will see if he\u2019s ready to go when the team returns after the All-Star break. Timmins, the team\u2019s second-round pick in 2017, could help the team down the stretch if he\u2019s deemed ready.\nTed Wyman of the Winnipeg Sun looks back at the first half of the season now that the team hits their bye and All-Star week, suggesting that while many things have gone right for the Jets, perhaps the most disappointing part of the season has been the play of star forward Patrik Laine. The scribe writes that the third-year winger is having a miserable season despite having 25 goals at this point. Despite an 18-goal November, Laine has tallied just seven goals combined in the other three months and often looks like a rookie on the ice. Of course, he\u2019s only 20 years old still, so patience is needed.\nAfter struggling for much of the season and recently seeing his ice time dwindle, Tyson Jost is headed back to the AHL. The Colorado Avalanche today assigned Jost and Ryan Graves to the Colorado Eagles, giving them just 21 players on the roster.\nJost, 20, was the tenth overall pick in 2016 but has yet to really establish himself in the NHL. After a great freshmen season at the University of North Dakota, the offensive center signed his entry-level contract and made his debut down the stretch for the Avalanche. Last year he returned to the lineup full-time and recorded 22 points in 65 games, but has failed to really take a step forward in 2018-19. Jost hasn\u2019t been asked to play center on a regular basis this season given his struggles in the faceoff circle, and it\u2019s not clear exactly where he fits into the lineup in a perfect scenario.\nThat fit will have to be determined through his play in the minor leagues, as the young forward was clearly not progressing in the NHL. In 43 games he has just 15 points, despite being given ample opportunities on the powerplay for much of the year. Given that he does not penalty kill and is seeing fewer than ten minutes of even-strength ice time in recent weeks, playing in a top-six role for the Eagles is probably the best for his development. Jost can obviously be recalled at a moment\u2019s notice given the proximity of the AHL team, and currently does not require waivers.\nGraves meanwhile could be back up before the Avalanche hit the ice on Saturday against the Los Angeles Kings, but he too had been used extremely sparingly by head coach Jared Bednar during his time in the NHL. The 23-year old defenseman has logged fewer than 12 minutes of ice time in each of his eight appearances, though he does have two goals already to show for his short NHL career.\nPoll: Should Colorado Move Semyon Varlamov?\nThe Colorado Avalanche returned third-string goalie Pavel Francouz to the AHL today. Yet, at this point in their season, it is fair to ask whether that move actually makes the team better. The Avs finally snapped a six-game win-less streak on Friday night against the New York Rangers and have fallen out of the once-competitive Central Division race over the past month. Colorado\u2019s struggles are not singular in nature \u2013 a lack of secondary scoring and a struggling penalty kill have played a part \u2013 but poor performance in net has been the most pressing issue facing the team. After a hot start to the season, Semyon Varlamov has regressed to a .912 save percentage and 2.80 GAA and has missed the team\u2019s past two games with a lower-body injury. Off-season acquisition Philipp Grubauer has yet to settle in with Colorado, holding a career-worst .902 save percentage and 3.13 GAA thus far.\nConsidering that Varlamov\u2019s play is not currently winning games for the Avalanche, the team could opt to move on from the veteran keeper. Despite Varlamov\u2019s recent slump, the impending unrestricted free agent would still be a valued name on the trade market as the NHL Trade Deadline grows closer. Several teams will be looking for a rental for the stretch run and postseason and Varlamov could potentially be the closest thing to a bona fide starter that could hit the market. Why then would the playoff-bound Avalanche want to move Varlamov if he\u2019s still a top NHL option? The return would be substantial and could \u2013 either directly or by flipping part of the return \u2013 result in Colorado adding the forward depth they so desperately need. It was recently reported that the Avs are hesitant to move their top prospects and young roster players for help, which could force them to move an established veteran like Varlamov.\nThe Avalanche could benefit from some addition by subtraction when it comes to Varlamov as well. The aforementioned Francouz, in his first season in North America after an illustrious European career, has made the transition look easy this season. Recently named an AHL All-Star, Francouz, 28, has a .919 save percentage and 2.65 GAA through 23 games with the Colorado Eagles. Perhaps more impressively, Francouz has made two NHL relief appearances and has saved 33 of the 35 shots that he faced (.943 SV%). The Denver Post\u2019s Sean Keeler writes that head coach Jared Bednar considered making Francouz the starter over Grubauer last night and opined that the current third-string could be the X-factor for the Avs this season. Francouz is also an impending UFA and the team should take a longer look at him this season to determine if he could be a long-term option alongside Gruabauer. An extended stay in Denver this season would certainly help convince Francouz to stick around as well.\nOf course, if the Avalanche were to trade Varlamov this season, it would very likely hurt their chances at a Stanley Cup title. Despite his struggles, Varlamov has outplayed Grubauer and has years of success to fall back on, as opposed to his young backup and Francouz, an unproven import. Colorado would likely have to turn around and add another option in net if they were to trade Varlamov. However, given that the Avs face a probable playoff route through the Nashville Predators and Winnipeg Jets this season, it could be that they favor improving the team for the future rather than clinging to slim title chances. The team could also feel that addressing their needs at forward is a priority compared to maintaining depth in net.\nWhat do you think? Should the Avalanche change things up by trading Varlamov for young pieces or forward help and hand the reins to Grubauer and Francouz? Or should they hold on to their established starter in hopes that it is their best chance at a Cup run this season?\nThe Colorado Avalanche announced they have recalled goaltender Pavel Francouz from the Colorado Eagles of the AHL. Head coach Jared Bednar said that Semyon Varlamov was a little banged up and Francouz was recalled as a precaution. The 28-year-old was up earlier this month and was impressive in a relief stint on Dec. 22 when he saved 21 of 22 shots against Arizona in 29 minutes of work. Francouz, who signed as a free agent with Colorado in the offseason out of the KHL has performed well in the AHL as well, posting a 13-7-1 record and a .919 save percentage. With Varlamov expected to hit free agency at the end of the season, Francouz could be a strong candidate to fill the backup role next season.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes have assigned forward Janne Kuokkanen to the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL, according to CapFriendly. The 20-year-old prospect has had trouble finding a positive role with the Hurricanes, despite being dominant in the AHL. Kuokkanen has yet to score in seven games and has seen his playing time dwindle to under 10 minutes in the past three games. He will return to Charlotte where he has already equaled his goal output from last year and can continue working on his game. The team followed that up announcing the promotion of Saku Maenalanen from Charlotte to fill Kuokkanen\u2019s shoes. Maenalanen has appeared in just one game for the Hurricanes, but has scored seven goals and 14 points in 31 games for the Checkers.\nWhile it\u2019s already been reported that the Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 recent trade acquisition Jason Garrison cleared waivers earlier today, NBC Sports Charlie Roumeliotis reports that Blackhawks\u2019 general manager Stan Bowman said Garrison will be assigned to the Rockford Ice Hogs of the AHL. Garrison, picked up in Sunday\u2019s trade with Drake Caggulia for Brandon Manning, has played in 17 games with the Oilers this year. He did play 58 games with the Chicago Wolves last season when playing for the Vegas franchise.\nAfter two years in the Swiss League, former NHLer Bobby Sanguinetti has returned to North America, as the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL announced they have signed the 30-year-old veteran to an AHL deal. The defenseman, who played 45 games with the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes, played with the Checkers for three years before spending the last two years in Switzerland. Sanguinetti, a former first-round pick in 2006, will hope to resurrect his career there.\nThe Nashville Predators announced they have assigned Nicholas Baptiste to the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL. The team recalled him Monday to serve as an emergency player for their game against Washington, but now have returned the 23-year-old without getting him into a game. Baptiste has played 34 games for Milwaukee and has six goals and 14 points.\nThe Minnesota Wild have recalled defenseman Ryan Murphy from AHL Iowa per a team release. This will be the 25-year-old\u2019s first stint in the NHL this season but he has 172 games of NHL experience between Carolina and Minnesota over the past six seasons. Murphy has played in 27 games in the minors this season with three goals and 10 assists.\nThe Colorado Avalanche went out of its way to bring in goaltender Philipp Grubauer via trade during the offseason to be their heir apparent in goal, but with Semyon Varlamov playing well throughout this season, Grubauer hasn\u2019t had much of a chance to claim that role. However, that might be changing.\nWith the team having lost five of their last seven games and Varlamov struggling, the team got a brilliant performance from Grubauer on Tuesday as he saved 35 shots in a 2-1 win over the Montreal Canadiens. After that performance, The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark (subscription required) wonders if this is the turning point where Grubauer takes over as the team\u2019s No. 1 goaltender. With Varlamov slated to hit unrestricted free agency this summer, the team needs for Grubauer to take that next step and that looks to be the case. In the last six starts (not including Friday\u2019s 2-1 loss to Chicago), the 27-year-old is 5-0-1 with a 2.29 GAA and a .936 save percentage.\n\u201c(Grubauer) gives us a chance. He gives us a real good chance,\u201d head coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cHe keeps it at 1-0 and guys are saying the right things on the bench. \u2026 I just felt like he looked really solid in the net. Like he was in control tonight. I haven\u2019t felt that way about our goaltending for the last little bit and that\u2019s what we need.\nThe Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required) writes that when winger Brendan Perlini was traded from the Arizona Coyotes to Chicago Blackhawks, he had high hopes that a change of scenery would jumpstart his career as he has struggled to put up points. However, while the Blackhawks liked what they have seen from center Dylan Strome, Perlini quickly found himself on the team\u2019s fourth line and even found himself a healthy scratch early on. \u201cTo be honest, you never like to sit, but it\u2019s good because I can watch the game and say, OK, here\u2019s certain spots where maybe I can get the puck or things like that or realize watching I can settle down there, there\u2019s a lot more time than I actually think. Like I said, you never like watching, but you can take good things from it. I think I\u2019ve done that and just try to build off it and learn every day.\u201d Perlini since then has looked much more comfortable and has picked up a couple of goals in the past four games. The hope is he continues to make adjustments in Chicago\u2019s lineup.\nKen Wiebe of the Winnipeg Sun writes that with the impressive play shown by Winnipeg Jets\u2019 goaltender Laurent Brossoit can be attributed back to last year when the back-up lost his job in Edmonton to Al Montoya and he found himself in the AHL for the remainder of the season. That experience made him work harder to get back to the NHL. \u201cNow I\u2019m more aware of who I am as a goalie and as a professional, if that makes any sense,\u201d said Brossoit. \u201cIt was unfortunate I had to go through those growing pains during my biggest opportunity with that club. I wouldn\u2019t say that I performed at the level I normally do.\u201d Brossoit was offered to return to Edmonton, but instead opted to start fresh in Winnipeg.\nThe NHL has issued a $2,000 fine to Colorado Avalanche forward Mikko Rantanen, citing two instances in which he broke Rule 64 for Diving/Embellishment this season. Fines will increase for Rantanen for any subsequent instances, and eventually include financial punishment to head coach Jared Bednar as well. The first incident, which garnered just a warning, was on October 16th against the New York Rangers, while the latest was during a November 14th game against the Boston Bruins.\nRantanen has been one of the league\u2019s brightest stars this season and still leads the entire NHL in scoring with 32 points. His play alongside Nathan MacKinnon has been a revelation, and has the Avalanche poised to become one of the league\u2019s most dangerous offensive teams. Unfortunately with this history, he\u2019ll now be watched even more closely by the officials and may not get the benefit of the doubt on close calls. He also could very well draw the ire of his coaching staff if he causes them to be fined, or costs his team with an ill-timed penalty.\nWith a dominant top line that includes Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen, the Colorado Avalanche can\u2019t be happier as they have combined for 75 points so far this season. However, the biggest concern for the team has been their secondary scoring, which most recently seems to have improved when the team re-inserted center Tyson Jost together with wingers Alex Kerfoot and Colin Wilson, according to Kyle Newman of the Denver Post.\nJost had spent some time with that line earlier this year, but between a demotion to the team\u2019s fourth line and an injury that kept him out for four games, Jost finally got a chance to center the two wingers and has made the most of his opportunity with a pair of goals in the past week as well as improved play from both Wilson and Kerfoot.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T02:31:08Z", "url": "https://www.prohockeyrumors.com/coaches/jared-bednar", "byte_size": 19018, "char_size": 18876}

{"text": "By now, everyone is familiar with spam - those annoying messages from strangers that clog your inbox everyday. While a good amount of these unsolicited messages are harmless people looking to establish a web presence, some of them are out to cripple your computer with malware, or even worse, thieve your identity with scams.\nOne of the biggest threats on the web today is the abundance of phishing emails, a crime that has negatively impacted unknowing consumers and well known organizations alike.\nPhishing involves the sending of fraudulent messages that appear to be from a reputable business. These phishing emails typically make request that you update your account information to prevent termination. Some will actually claim that someone has already tampered into your account and request these details, purporting as if they are assisting in the matter.\nTo the uninformed eye, phishing emails look very genuine. Those sending a phishing email will use email addresses and active links that appear identical, finely designed logos, and even impersonate the names of known companies like PayPal, eBay, AOL, Earthlink, Wells Fargo, or Comerica Bank. Inside the phishing message, someone claiming to be a company representative will ask you to enter confidential details or click a link that supposedly redirects you to your account.\nThe information they request may be anything from the password to your bank account to a Social Security number. Giving up this information could not only lead to unauthorized withdrawal of your funds, but a full blown case of identity theft.\nIt\u2019s rather ironic that phishing emails use social engineering to lure their victims into financial jeopardy. They prey on your fears of being victimized by fraud, hoping you\u2019ll be alarmed and fall into their web of deceit.

Responding with sensitive details to an unsolicited message could have your confidential information circulating on the black market of phishers and malware coders.\n\u2022 If the email appears concerning, conduct some investigating. If the message is sent by an institution that you do business with, contacting them about the matter is a good idea. You can report the phishing email to them as well. This is an easy way to determine if someone is attempting to bait you with an phishing email. In most instances, a legitimate company will never ask you to submit such personal information via email - this is the ultimate red flag.\nWe all must be aware of phishing emails, as they have the ability to inflict damage from different angles.

{"text": "Old Holborn left a message on Tom Harris\u2019s blog, which propmted me to leave a message for you.My blog roll consists of three names and you are one of them!I have been through terrible depressions myself, even lacking the will to live, which was mainly due to constantly worrying about the state of the world and my own feeble efforts, but then I started lightening up because the Almighty God is in control and so I don\u2019t need to worry every minute of the day.Friends had to drum this fact into my head.I started turning my concerns into opportunities. Instead of getting depressed, I started a website. I stopped worrying what people think of me and started speaking my mind.I know from feedback that I have helped people see things differently. They have thanked me.You are much bigger than me, so many more people will have benefited from your insight.Maybe a change would help. I moved to a new house and I decided I was going to enjoy it no matter what. I guess you don\u2019t have to move to make that decision. Just trust in Christ and do it. The Good Shepherd won\u2019t let us down. I used to worry about the lost sheep. How can *I* save them, I used to beat myself up with, but He will keep the 99 safe while the lost one is returned safely to the fold.I am sure that, through God\u2019s grace, all will be gathered together whose names are written in the Book of Life.At church at the weekend, we were reminded that one of the most important things about being a Christian is the waiting. Waiting upon the glorious return of Christ.While we\u2019re waiting, take some rest as you need to. And remember, depressions *always* pass. I guarantee this. I am somewhat of an expert after several decades of the things. Get some antidepressants if you need to. Plenty of Christians are on them. I\u2019ve been on them.

{"text": "I have often asked practitioners what they found the most challenging thing in the entire patient management process.\nOver the years I have realised beginner practitioners have challenges in one of the following processes that incorporates a homoeopathic case management.\n2) Case analysis that also includes miasmatic totality, susceptibility and prognosis.\n3) Creating a Totality of Symptoms.\n4) Matching this totality with the most indicated remedies in the Materia Medica \u2013 includes use of repertorization process.\n5) Differential diagnosis and determining the first prescription and dose.\n6) Eliciting Remedy Response and determining the second prescription/s until the case improves completely depending on the scope of homoeopathy.\nPersonally when I started my practice, the most frustrating part of case management process was matching my totality with the most indicated remedy in the Materia Medica.\nWhile I seemed to do quite well with my case taking and I could even elicit the totality and core essence of a case well, I struggled to find a remedy that matched this state.\nOne possible reason could be that there were a just handful of remedies that I could say I knew really well in those years and prescribe confidently. While we were \"taught\" around 400 remedies in my training and were expected to memorize them well, I could never manage to remember them.\nI could never understand remedies from reading a book directly because they lacked something. The only remedies that I could ever learn and still remember clearly were those those that were filtered through a clinical case. I found it extremely futile and boring to memorize a set of indications of remedies just because they were dumped together in a book.\nHaving said that I thoroughly enjoyed the clinical cases from books journals or in lectures. I spent hours going through journals and archived cases to find my remedies. I observed cases being prescribed by my teachers in practice and made sure I recorded the remedy indications and the response that followed during the followups. I would compare cases of the same remedy. The idea was to see the many varied expressions of a remedy in clinic, using various approaches and to really get that depth of the remedy understanding and pathogenesis.\nNow this was a slower process and while I knew some remedies really well, my materia medica was quite limited. So it was rare for a remedy to pop in my head as soon as I took the case in my first few years of practice unless I had read or seen it prescribed before.\nHence the only way I could find remedies in most of my cases was by repertorizing and trying newer remedies if they were indicated.\nThe most tricky part for me was converting the symptoms into rubrics. While the totality of the case was quite clear and depended on the \"stage\" I took the case at, I wanted to make sure that the rubrics exactly represented the depth, core and essense of my patient's totality.\n(For more information on the concept of stages and its relevance in homoeopathic practice, kindly have a read of the free ebook - The Quest for Simillimum on the left of this page).\nOver the years after some extensive research into the repertorization process and making many mistakes, I could come to a stage where the process has become much easier. I want to share some hints that have helped me over the years to ensure that one can take the best possible rubrics that are represented in a case.\nI will explain this through a case example so you can understand the subtle differences in the type of rubrics chosen, what to take and what not to take in a given patient.\nDon't forget to put your thoughts on what you think about this in the discussion forum below.\nSohani Gonzalez Nov. 12, 2013, 10:23 p.m.\nJust want to say Shilpa ~ a very clear and helpful description on how you found this remedy ( of which I have never used yet in 30 year s) I hope that a case comes my way now ~ all very exciting !\nShilpa Bhouraskar Nov. 13, 2013, 11:33 a.m.\nYes it is one of those remedies that needs to be a polycrest but isn't. I look forward to your experiences.\nSarah Daniel Nov. 12, 2013, 11:01 p.m.\nThanks for going through this case, Shilpa. As you described the dynamics of this emotional sensitivity leading to a diversion into pleasant fantasy I said to myself, I wonder if this could possibly be Pip-m? I have had some success with this remedy and have found that people who need it tend to be almost incapable of solving big problems in their lives (like real happiness at work, or what to do about health problems, or what to do about a relationship) because as soon as they get a signal that something isn't just right, they look away. Can't help it. It's an instantaneous response. I'm very happy to have seen this case of yours; it deepens my learning about how the remedy state might express itself physically, and how the case can be translated into the rubrics so the picture of which remedy is best comes clear.\nShilpa Bhouraskar Nov. 13, 2013, 2:55 p.m.\nThanks for sharing your experiences Sarah.\nNiki Nov. 14, 2013, 12:48 a.m.\nThank you for posting such a beautiful wonderful case! You have no idea how much I just learned from you about kava kava. So, I approach homeopathy from a different perspective. In addition to being a homeopath, I am also a pharmacist and a hypnotherapist. I'm also a medical intuitive. My intuitive gifts are auditory, so usually within the first few minutes of someone giving me their case, if their problem stems from a past life trauma, I know what it is. (I do a lot of past life regression in my practice.) I am so glad that the kava kava works so well. I have never studied that remedy, and it makes me think that perhaps kava kava is a wonderful remedy for helping the person forget their past life traumas. I can't wait to read more about the natural history of that remedy. So, I will tell you what I got in the first minute - he was a dog in his past life. He had a wonderful life, and loved the family he was with. His dreams reflect the happy memory of his past life - laying on a lawn, and dreaming of chasing rabbits - his favorite past time.\nAfter they dragged him away by the neck, they shot him in the head- in the temple. They were trying to protect their children - thinking that if he bit an adult, he might bite the children. But he was protecting the children, and he got shot. It was such a shock for him that he carried it with him into his next life.\nI am so happy that the kava kava worked! You have given him back his joy and allowed him to live free and happy again. The only thing I would have done differently is that sensing that he had a past life trauma, I would have removed the trauma first with a past life regression so he wouldn't aggravate. (Aggravations are often caused from past life traumas.) But you can always do a past life regression at any time, to remove any subconscious trauma and allow him to get the learning of his past life as a dog!\nI have to be honest, I am so sensitive to pain and trauma that I had to turn off the video several times! In fact, I almost didn't listen to the rest of the case, but if I hadn't, I never would have learned that Kava kava helps a person forget their past lives so they can move forward with joy and happiness in their current life. What a wonderful remedy.\nI had a hard time listening to him suffer, when he saw his fellow animal friends being butchered, but I'm glad I listened to the entire case, because if I hadn't, I would have never learned about the wonderful useful properties as kava kava on past life traumas!\nKava kava is probably a wonderful remedy for homoepathic physicians, because they have so many people coming to see them, and they don't have time to do a past life regression on everyone with a past life trauma.\nThank you Shilpa, for teaching such a wonderful case, and for teaching me so much about the wonderful properties of kava kava!\nShilpa Bhouraskar Nov. 14, 2013, 11:20 a.m.\nThanks for sharing your insight and offering a fascinating perspective to the case. I have never done or seen past life regression therapy so I will definitely have a read of Brian's work.\nDr.Mehru seth Nov. 24, 2013, 11:56 a.m.\nyou ..I want to tell u I have learnt so much from you .\nThanks alot .look forward to u for further experiences and cases .\nAsefa Adam Firdosy Nov. 27, 2013, 3:06 a.m.\nThanks Shilpa for explaining the case so clearly.I have not used this remedy yet.I have learned about the rubrics you gathered to reach the remedy.Through this interestin and wonderful case you have intoduce kava kava s wonderful properties.\nThanks Shilpa and waiting for more experiences and case study.\nsarang Dec. 12, 2013, 11:10 p.m.\nGood analysis of the case giving a nice understanding of the drug.\nPrabhas Mishra May 18, 2018, 12:07 a.m.\nIt was great Shilpa!

{"text": "This time, players can use communication features in the game to show each other the unique houses they have made.\nHH Showcase where you can check out homes belonging to people you have encountered via the StreetPass feature, just as you would view a show home. When we came up with this idea, we wanted to make it so it was as little trouble as possible for players to make use of this feature.\nExactly. In the end, we made it so all you need to do is have StreetPass switched on.\nDream Suite run by Luna, which we touched upon earlier.\nWell, a fair while ago, when you originally announced the Wii, you explained the concept of WiiConnect249 and gave the example of a friend coming over to play while you\u2019re asleep.9. WiiConnect24: A Wii network service that is always connected to the internet, allowing automatic downloads of the latest news and other messages. Please note, the WiiConnect24 service is not available in South Africa.\nAh, yes. That\u2019s right. That was the first thing I wanted us to try when we made WiiConnect24.\nIt was something I wanted to include on the Wii game, but there were all sorts of constraints which meant that we couldn\u2019t do it, and I\u2019ve regretted it ever since. This time, we finally managed it, so if you upload your town\u2019s data to the server, someone can simply drop by to play while you\u2019re sleeping. We pitched that as a kind of dream world, so we made the place where you have these dreams into the Dream Suite.\nIt\u2019s a dream world, so whatever you do in a town you visit won\u2019t leave any traces or after-effects for the person whose town it is.\nRight. If someone sees your town and messes it all up, it\u2019s just a dream, so there will be no changes to your town in reality.\nWith such a safe way for others to see your town, there\u2019s no need to exchange Friend Codes10. We wanted an easier way to just leave your town open and let people see it more easily. The Dream Suite means you can go to a complete stranger\u2019s town, and they can come and visit yours.10. Friend Code: An ID allocated when a Wii, Nintendo DS or Nintendo 3DS owner connects to the Internet. By exchanging Friend Codes, players can play specially designed games together online.\nAlso, if they are willing to give out their designs in the towns you visit, Wendell can give you the designs that you like.\ngo on all kinds of tours there , which are like mini-games, via a process of random matching.\nSo you will be randomly paired with someone you don\u2019t know, and you can play together.\nCorrect. But of course, it doesn\u2019t have to be a stranger. You could invite a friend, or take a tour by yourself. But we did make it so that it would be simple for someone who doesn\u2019t have a friend playing to take part. It\u2019s not like this takes place in your town\u2026 it\u2019s on a separate island.\nSo you don\u2019t have to worry about any damage being done to your town.\nRight. We\u2019ve always wanted to ensure that players can communicate safely and securely, and I think we have achieved that this time.\nAnd close friends can still come and go between each other\u2019s towns, as they have up to now.\nYes. In addition to friends with whom you have exchanged Friend Codes, you can register other players as \u2018best friends\u2019 in the game, and there are exclusive communicative elements you can share with them.\nCan you explain more about these \u2018best friends\u2019?\nWell, let\u2019s say you have a copy of the game and play together with your family. This means that four of you can play, as it has been in previous titles. But only one of you can be mayor, while the others will be regular townsfolk.\nThere might be four people playing, but they will share the same Friend Code, as it is assigned to the Nintendo 3DS system. That means that someone in the family might visit a friend, but then meet someone there who they don\u2019t know at all. We were worried that this might feel awkward.\nIt would be a shock if your friend\u2019s mother, let\u2019s say, whom you had never met, suddenly appeared in your town.\nThis time round, we made it so that each of the four players could designate certain close friends as \u2018best friends\u2019, and you can make it so only these \u2018best friends\u2019 can come and visit. What\u2019s more, if you\u2019re connected to the Internet at home, \u2019best friends\u2019 can exchange messages without having to go to each other\u2019s town.\nIn previous titles, when you wanted to let a friend know you were planning to visit their town, you\u2019d need to give them a call or send them an email. Now you can do that inside the game.\ninformation about the price of turnips 11.11. Turnips: Items used for investment purposes in Animal Crossing and available for purchase every week on Sunday morning. If the selling price exceeds what you bought them for, you will earn pocket money.\nSo you were all interested in the price of the turnips you can buy on Sundays from Joan ?\nEven when people are connected online, there are players who still don\u2019t really want to make the effort to visit someone else\u2019s town. But I\u2019d be happy if turnips inspired players to go and check out each other\u2019s towns.\nBut turnips don\u2019t have to be the only reason. You could decide to hold a fishing competition.\nThat\u2019s right. Or you could meet up to exchange fruit. There are all sorts of opportunities.\nCome to think of it, in the edition of Nintendo Direct broadcast on 29th August last year, there was a kind of comic foreground of me, where you could put your face through an image and take a photograph. Well, I didn\u2019t actually notice it until the video was completed.\nWell, when I saw that, I was amazed \u2013 I thought: \u201cWow, you can do things like that?\u201d That would make another reason to visit another town.\nThat\u2019s right. Everybody can come up with their own designs.\nIf there\u2019s one that you like, you can stick your face through the hole and take a souvenir photo.\nIn Japan, the title of the game is Animal Crossing: Jump Out!, and I hope that everyone will have the opportunity to jump up, head out and visit other players, as that title suggests.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T16:21:33Z", "url": "https://www.nintendo.co.za/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Animal-Crossing-New-Leaf/Animal-Crossing-New-Leaf/4-Visiting-Homes-and-Towns-Wirelessly/4-Visiting-Homes-and-Towns-Wirelessly-738771.html", "byte_size": 6059, "char_size": 5959}
{"text": "\u201cSo, did the cleaning lady come?\u201d I asked him.\nA cleaning lady refused to clean my house! (So, it is true. You really do have to clean your house before the cleaning lady arrives.) I would have happily paid her $100 for four hours worth of work, but she rejected me and my money. Furthermore, she cost herself a customer because I will never again call her and offer her work.\nI am mortified and mystified that my kitchen and bathroom were deemed too big of a job for one person to handle in four hours.\nThat\u2019s nutty! I could clean my whole house in four hours if I really put my mind to it\u2013BY MYSELF! Sheesh\u2026sounds like you found a cleaning lady that\u2019s SPOILED!\nI wonder what her house looks like \u2013 my aunt was a cleaning lady, and although her clients\u2019 homes were spotless, hers has always been in a bit of chaos.\nMost of the cleaning people around here require this same \u201cfirst time\u201d fee. Our house was, quite literally, brand new when we hired a cleaning lady. It had been built just two weeks before we moved in. Still, nearly everyone we interviewed also wanted a first clean fee\u2026.If you have the time to look around, you can probably find someone who won\u2019t charge it. We eventually did, though ours really, geuinely didn\u2019t require it.\nyou are too funny! and while i realize that children totally send our lives into disarray, i also know you\u2026neat as a pin.\ni am so sure she couldn\u2019t clean your kitchen and bathroom! ridiculous lady!\nI just hired a cleaning lady and your story was my worst fear. So, before she came by to give us an estimate, I felt like I had to CLEAN my house for the cleaning lady. How warped is that?\nOurs did charge us about $30 more for the first visit, where they do a deep clean. I can understand that though as things like my windows and blinds have rarely been cleaned and I won\u2019t even go into my lighting fixtures. When you don\u2019t have a maid there are just things you don\u2019t find time to do (at least I don\u2019t).\nIt sounds like this maid might have been a little high-maintenance though. Maybe you can find another who isn\u2019t so picky. When I walked around with my new one and told her I\u2019d make sure the kids toys were picked up, she kind of chuckled like she was thinking that\u2019s not necessary\u2026so who knows what they expect really!\nI\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. And no way would I ever consider seeing how much it would be to clean MY house! Yikes!\nwow\u2026 that is super lame!\nRemind me never to hire a cleaning lady!\nI clean houses for a living. I do not charge extra the first time I go. It is easier and I get it done faster if people just pick up any clutter that may be around. Since I don\u2019t live there, i would not know where it goes to put it away. That is the only thing I like people to do before I clean, otherwise they are doing my job, and what is the point? I usually clean 2 bathrooms, kitchen, family room, dining room, bedrooms in three or four hours. Three hours, I charge 50.00, 4 hours is 70.00. I do extra stuff all the time, like windows, blinds, I have cleaned basements, moved furniture, power washed outside patios, you name it. LOL I have loyal customers, and I am good to them back.\nPeople are LAZY. They want something for nothing. I used to clean houses for a living. I enjoyed it most of the time. $100 for cleaning a kitchen, dining room and what did you say, a bathroom? I can\u2019t remember. I could have cleaned your whole home for $100 and four hours, give or take a few minutes. People really are lazy I tell you.\nAnd whoever said that her aunt cleaned houses and hers was a wreck \u2013 I knew a girl like that. She was a sloppy cleaner too. I on the other hand had a neat and tidy home until I had baby number 3. And it goes downhill from there on many a day now.\nOMG! I could get my daughter to clean it for less.\nI hate cleaning ladies. There is no end to the trouble they have caused me. Go Mel! Good job for cleaning your own stuff.\negads! One would have thought she could have at least TRIED!\nI\u2019m hoping Karen (above) lives in Oklahoma City. I could use her!\nI want someone to pick up the clutter.\nThat doesn\u2019t take much time at all.\nOh, why do I love clutter so much?\nThat seems like a mighty high hourly rate for a cleaning lady. Mine charges $13/hour. Two of them come and clean my large house with 4 bathrooms in 2 1/2 hours. $65 for clean house. Best investment ever made.\nI\u2019m with Judy\u2026I love clutter too much, too, tho it drives me crazy. I once was a cleaning lady, when my kids were little and in school. I cleaned the houses of several people in my church whenever I was needed\u2026part-time and not every week, but the extra $50 came in handy when it was time to buy shoes for the kids or whatever. Boy, even without \u2018snooping\u2019, it\u2019s amazing what you learn about other people\u2019s lives. But one thing I was was discreet and I never talked about anything I saw or learned in anyone\u2019s home. People trusted me, and word-of-mouth kept me busy. I cleaned houses without a speck of dust in them\u2026I cleaned absolute MESSES! All in a day\u2019s work. Back then, we ladies charged $10 per hour\u2026I can\u2019t imagine what the going rate is now.\nA cleaning lady who wouldn\u2019t clean? she\u2019s in the wrong business! I have a great cleaning lady, she comes every 3 weeks. She\u2019s reasonable, she\u2019s good and trustworthy. The good ones ARE out there.\nI\u2019m Lisa, btw, I found my way over from Kellans.\nKeep looking- not all cleaning ladies are this way. My mom cleans houses and has a very loyal customer base, they actually do what they can just to keep her. She is purely word of mouth and has more people calling than she can keep up with. She will do a first time walk through and discuss what they want done, what she can get done in that time and a set amount and what day works. She requires them to declutter and be out of the house when she comes- people get in the way and slow her down. Most people like this because it helps keep them organized and not fall behind week to week. She is efficient, picky and knows her stuff. She will tell people what kind of cleaning supplies work best, they purchase that kind. She has even been asked to pick out someones new vacuum- she likes that because she\u2019s used so many different ones that she knows which work best and which have no suction\u2026..anyways, hope your search goes better.\nKaren, would you consider relocating to Nebraska? lol My house is a disaster. Between having a chronic illness and a full time job \u2013 my house is a disaster. I feel like I can\u2019t afford a cleaning lady. Besides the clutter in place would choke a horse!\nLOL I have helped pick out one of my customers new vacuums as well. Somebody mentoned nobody would to clean their house because it was an older farm house, yesterday I cleaned a farm house that is close to 100 years old. They have three dogs running around. LOL They are good people and I love cleaning for them. Good cleaning help is hard to find, but we are out there! I have become friends with all of the people I clean for. Also Mel, I cannot imagine walking into somebody\u2019s house and not even attempting to clean it. That is rude, and very unprofessional. She could have at least tried to do as much as she could in that time period.

{"text": "The LDA is pleased to announce that the Lyme bill, HR 4701, July 23, 2014 version, passed with voice vote out of the Energy & Commerce Committee, today, July 30.\nThe battle for passage of this bill began early this year when LDA met with House leadership to present objections to a vector-borne diseases bill from being introduced in the House Health Subcommittee that would have covered Lyme disease but had no representation at all from patients and physicians and would not have covered other tick-borne diseases because of incidence rates. The LDA provided language changes which provided patient input and transparency. The bill was brought before the Subcommittee, but an amendment in the nature of a substitute was offered and passed out instead\u2014a substitute that was dangerous for patients.\nThe LDA led a nationwide campaign to bring back patient friendly language and had a letter signed by 154 groups nationwide stating what was necessary from a patient perspective which was sent to all of the Members of the Energy & Commerce Committee. We then worked with Mr. Gibson and the Committee to change the language to produce a bill which will help provide a research agenda for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases including evaluating chronic or persistent infection and co-infections.\nThe LDA thanks Mr. Gibson, bill sponsor; Mr. C. Smith; and Mr. Upton and all of the Committee members who supported the bill. We also thank our partner groups who were instrumental in the effort to pass this legislation, and all Lyme groups across the country, patients, and other groups who worked on this effort. The next step for the bill is to go to the House floor, which will probably occur sometime after the summer Congressional recess.\nDay 2 video (7/30), bill voting, is in the second video box, begins at 33:20.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T00:45:34Z", "url": "https://lymediseaseassociation.org/federal-legislation/legislative-session-2013-2014/federal-lyme-bill-passes-out-of-committee/", "byte_size": 1816, "char_size": 1814}

{"text": "Joe Logon, my former co-worker/manager, briefly opined about the TSA blog. I decided to take a stab in the dark and share my thoughts on the new blog that our government is running to help address the concerns, the stealth-like knowledge and alleged secrecy in that part of the government.\nLayout: The blog is very clean and simple, using Blogger under the hood. The lack of widgets and other distracting devices places focus solely on the content, which should be the goal of a blog. The headlines stand out, but require you to scroll down the page to see it. Conversely to content above the fold, anything below the fold gets minimal attention; so I suggest they place a widget on the sidebar with \u201cMost Commented\u201d so users can find popular content without necessarily scrolling down.\nBlog\u2019s Purpose: The true intent is to discuss openly concerns and policy changes within the TSA, \u201c\u2026facilitate an ongoing dialogue on innovations in security, technology and the checkpoint screening process.\u201d Despite this, frustrated users often drive the discussion into negative feedback targeted against the TSA and the blog author(s).\n\u201cMeet Our Bloggers\u201d: I\u2019ll echo what Joe said, that is, the blog should detail the blogger\u2019s full names or a lead editor. Blogging via pseudo-first name aliases removes some of the trust (and accessibility) from the bloggers. Blogging is about communication, trust and being straightforward \u2014 not just sweetening press releases; which I can see the site potentially scaling back and doing.\nVideos: Why aren\u2019t they using YouTube, Metacafe, Revver or some other online video service to play videos? Not only will videos play much better, they can reach a much larger audience and capture people to visit their blog. Windows Media just isn\u2019t a great way for your audience to watch it.\nHeader Image: Although I like the image, it seems too generic. They should include a photo montage of the American flag, a picture of an airport (or security screening) and include official branding on it. In addition, linking the header image to the main blog page is apropos as it can function as a part of the navigation, subconsciously.\nBlogging Activity: Overall, I appreciate the candid nature of the bloggers there. They seem to be doing a pretty darn good job embracing their diverse audience and have been answering questions from the comments. However, I suggest they break big posts up into chunks and post them with full details on each point. This is mainly because not a lot of people have enough passion to read a full blog entry, they just focus on the finer, important points of it. Aside from that, I hope they keep it up!\nAdditionally, I think it\u2019s a good move by the government to embrace social media. I believe that other departments of the government could actually benefit from a blog, not just the TSA.\nWhat other functions should the government be blogging about?

{"text": "A lot has changed since the Federal Reserve decided in September once again to take a pass at raising interest rates and normalizing monetary policy. For hawks, not much of it has been particularly good.\nWhen choosing not to move last month, the Federal Open Market Committee referred to some vague \"international developments\" it was monitoring to decide when it would enact its first rate hike since 2006.\nFor Wall Street, the message was clear: Fed officials worried that the slowdown in China would spread to other areas of the global economy, dampening prospects at home and making it the wrong time to lift off from the zero-bound range where it has been for seven years.\nSince then, the news from China has gotten marginally better, with the government reporting that gross domestic product gained 6.9 percent in the most recent period.\nThe news from home, though, has improved little. Expectations for U.S. third-quarter GDP have tumbled in recent weeks, with the consensus now at just a 1.7 percent gain, according to FactSet, down from 3.9 percent in the inventory-inflated second quarter and well off hopes for 2.5 percent or better. CNBC's Rapid Update tracker has the estimate down to 1.4 percent.\nA batch of economic data points Tuesday helped drive home the weakness: Consumer confidence declined and was below economist expectations, orders for long-lasting goods fell in line with consensus at 1.2 percent, and the Markit Purchasing Managers Index survey of manufacturing activity hit its lowest level since January, with the hiring component particularly worrisome.\nIndeed, the jobs market, considered perhaps the brightest spot in the economy, has tailed off considerably, with September adding just 142,000 positions, according to the latest government report that came out after the last Fed meeting.\nNot to mention corporate profits, which currently are tracking for a 3.8 percent decline in the third quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\"Global weakness, a large inventory overhang, economic uncertainty \u2014 take your pick. The current environment leaves businesses hesitant to invest in everything from equipment to structures to additional employees,\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, said in summing up the most recent indicators.\nThe conditions add up to a headache for the Fed during a year in which Chair Janet Yellen and her top lieutenants repeatedly have expressed a desire to begin the rate normalization process. The first hike was supposed to happen in March, which would have been five months after the Fed ended its quantitative easing program, a series of monthly bond purchases that exploded the central bank's balance sheet past $4.5 trillion.\nNow, the target again appears to be March, but in 2016. Traders at the CME assign just a 1 in 20 chance that the FOMC will announce a hike on Wednesday. The outlook has dimmed so much that traders say there's a 16 percent probability the Fed will still hold steady next September.\nFed watchers should expect the FOMC to tone down its assessment of the economy in the statement it releases at the meeting's conclusion, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.\n\"The financial markets will treat the marking down of the Fed's near-term assessment of the economy as dovish, thereby further reducing the probability of a December 2015 rate hike, because the data will simply not be strong enough to convince the financial markets the Fed can actually begin tightening,\" LaVorgna said in a note.\n\"And if the Fed determines that it really wants to raise rates this year, the likely tightening in financial conditions that would accompany such a desire would give policymakers pause,\" he added. \"Therefore, we do not expect a rate hike until the March 2016 meeting at the earliest.\"\nSure, there's been a rebound of sort in the global equity markets, but even that only seems to exemplify how much investors have come to depend on monetary largess from the Fed and its global counterparts. The S&P 500 index had been in a sharp tumble around the time of the September meeting, falling more than 12 percent from its July peak until it cratered 12 days after the FOMC decision.\nSince then, the market is up nearly 10 percent, buoyed in part by hopes of a lower-for-longer Fed.\nSumming up the Faustian bargain between the two entities, Hans Mikkelsen, credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote, \"Global weakness is OK for U.S. markets as long as the Fed refrains from hiking rates, and vice versa it would be OK from a markets perspective for the Fed to begin hiking rates if global weakness diminishes (but not OK if US data rebounds in isolation).\"\nMikkelsen added that it's important the Fed acknowledge that the U.S. growth story is deteriorating.\n\"Hence risk assets have rallied for three weeks prompted by the turn to weaker U.S. data that began with the weak September jobs report, as the Fed's rate decision is understood to be completely data dependent,\" he said. \"However, clearly for the market rally to be sustained it would be helpful if (the) FOMC statement tilted dovish by acknowledging this turn to weaker U.S. data.\"", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T00:33:35Z", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/27/rate-hikers-at-the-fed-are-running-out-of-ammo.html", "byte_size": 5167, "char_size": 5165}

{"text": "Although he was a merciful warrior, David still had to fight Israel\u2019s enemies. This account is strange in that it seems the battles described here could have been avoided if only Hanun, the leader of Ammon, had taken David\u2019s sincere condolences at face value. But Hanun listened to his advisers, who gave him extremely poor advice! It could be that they truly, though erroneously, believed David\u2019s messengers were spies. Or these nobles of Ammon may have turned against David in hopes of provoking him and gaining a victory over Israel.\nWhatever the reason, David\u2019s men were humiliated by their Ammonite hosts with no provocation. Then the Ammonites raised an army of 33,000 mercenaries from neighboring Aramean states \u2014 another act of unprovoked aggression against Israel. David\u2019s army scored a resounding victory under the leadership of Joab and his brother Abishai.

{"text": "I have owned a Pyranha Traveller 15 in Royalite since about 1998. I bought it at a time when I was starting to get bored with my k k and wanted something that I could travel in a more leisurely manner with and carry more picnic food/camping gear and also take my dog with me.\nIn the initial years as I learnt to paddle in straighter lines it suffered very little damage even on white water as being light and manoeuvrable I was able to use my k k experience to throw it around reasonably well.\nHowever in the last few years I have tried ever more demanding waters and this resulted in September with me severely rattling the tail on a river in Scotland and subsequent inspection showed the start of several splits. It did not stop the canoe from being gaffer-taped up and used for another two days but I was being careful.\nOn my return to the south I purchased a We-No-Nah Prospector 15 which is a better boat for my type of paddling (and yes I have split the tail on that one too) but the Pyranha is a lovely boat and will last for years yet for myself and friends/family so it deserved a skid plate and some TLC.\nAs I said the Pyranha had a split \u2013 well several really.\nI was advised by Dave Crooks at Endless River \u2013 guess whose Skid Plate kit I used?? \u2013 to drill the ends of the splits to stop them running further as the hull flexed in future use.\nI used a small grinder to explore the cracks.\nI then ground off the very flaky pieces of outer plastic shell but tried to avoid getting into the foam base or taking too much of the unstuck plastic flaps off. I decided that dabbing some resin under the flaps would help stick them down.\nBut so what, I could see it! The line is just below the finger. I then sanded the hull within the lined area and on it using some non-clogging 3M sandpaper. I gave it a good rub all over making sure that I did up and down strokes, across strokes and round in circles movements for good measure \u2013 in fact everything that you would not want to do to wood \u2013 in order to make sure that I had a good surface to key the resin on to. I wiped down the hull with cloth and then used \u2018vanilla\u2019 flavoured nail polish remover from Boots \u2013 plenty left if you want some \u2013 as that was the only type of Acetone that I could find in town to finish with.\nI also cut some darts into the edge of the material so that it would fold a little easier around the curve of the stem. This had worked well on the We-No-Nah but was probably not necessary on this boat as the hull is not so finely proportioned.\nIt may assist if you have some help in doing the job if only for moral support!!\nI had seen a few other boats with resin runs and so I decided to mask mine off with tape.\nI then decided not to follow the instructions about using cardboard to wet out the patch. I had heard from several sources that an Endless River kit would not have enough resin \u2013 vehemently denied by Dave and Carolyn \u2013 but I was not taking the risk. I wet my patch on top of the boat working on the principle that any run off would only go on the place I wanted it anyway.\nAfter wetting the one side of the patch and slipping some gel in the flaps of loose plastic, I flipped the patch and wetted out the other side keeping a close watch on the time as the resin is curing once the hardener is mixed in. I then applied three longitudinal layers of cling film (this is something that there is plenty of!) and using a beer can started rolling out some air bubbles and making sure that the patch was smooth. In the photo you can see that one side is yellowier (unrolled) and the other side looks greener. A small fibre glassing roller (the sort with discs) would have been better on the wetted patch before the cling film but I could not find one for sale.\nAt this stage in future I will remove the masking tape and bags as it might be easier than after the resin has hardened.\nI then wrapped the end of the canoe in cling film giving it tight laminations and went off to clean the equipment and drink the beer!\nI did not turn my boat over as suggested in the instructions but without the masking tape and bags I would do.\nI am quite pleased with the finished result. It has not been on the water yet but the We-No-Nah has been scraped down rock several times and is standing up to the job well.\nNext time I will be more careful when I stir the resin and hardener as I feel I put too many air bubbles in the mix. Otherwise I am very happy with my result.\nI am sure there is more to be said but the instructions in the bucket from Endless River (plus nearly everything you need and there was sufficient resin) cover most things like perhaps wanting your patch higher up the stem of the front of the canoe (I have only patched my sterns so one kit did both boats) and the usual Health and Safety advice.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T21:19:07Z", "url": "http://www.songofthepaddle.co.uk/forum/content.php/26-Fitting-a-skid-plate-or-bang-plate?s=e02e2d9fa9e4afa82dd3d4b36778cfcd", "byte_size": 4812, "char_size": 4790}

We will spend a night in Belmopan, and then live with a host famiy in a nearby village for 2 1/2 weeks. We will attend training, all learn some basic Kriol, and get to know Belize. Next will be Community Based Training, where we will be living with another host family, and attending training specific to our assignmnet and region. Communication may be limited during this time, but remember, \"NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS!\" We will do our best to keep you updated.\nAfter a day of travel, we've made it to Peace Corps Staging in Miami, FL. We are now officially Peace Corps Trainees, again. Staging involves preparation to begin service, and we have joined over 30 individuals, from all over the United States, who are all headed to Belize. This afternoon we discussed basic Peace Corps Policies, as well as Peace Corps' Approach to Development and Safety and Security. The information has been the same as our last Staging for Kiribati, but it has been great getting to know the people we will be living and working with for the next 2 years. We have had some good rain, and we even had an unexpected break, when we were evacuated due to a fire alarm. We traveled down 20 flights of stairs and waited patiently for the Fire Department to check things out. It ended up being a false alarm. Just another reminder that when serving in the Peace Corps you must be flexible and ready for anything.\nStaging is over. It has been a great opportunity to hang out with our fellow Peace Corps Trainees. Our Staging Trainer, Kathy, went through the basics of Peace Corps. We discussed Peace Corp policies, managing risks, coping with unwanted attention, cross cultural adjustments, and safety and security. We discussed our aspirations and anxieties as well as the goals of Peace Corps and sustainable development. The best part has been trying to come up with songs to sing. At our welcome dinner in Kiribati, we will have to sing 3 songs as a group. Being in tune is plus, as are hand motions. We are all pretty nervvous about this, but plan on practicing before the big day. Skidamarink, Hokey Pokey, Twinkle Twinkle, and a Fly song are some of our options so far. We will let you know how it goes. We are now in LAX waiting for our flight to Nadi, Fiji. The flight is about 11 hours. Fiji, as well as Kiribati, is 18 hours ahead of Texas time, so as we wrote earlier, we lose a day and get there on Wednesday. As our journey gets going communication will be very limited. Our blog will be updated through snail mail.

{"text": "A good franchise lead questionnaire is going to produce quality leads, which is one responsibility of an effective sales VP. Such individuals aren\u2019t simply seeking to produce good leads, but leads which will be good franchisees down the line. Finding the right people is the difference between a good franchise operation and a great one.\nWhat interests you about our franchise?\nDo you have any debt? If so, how much and what kind? What is your plan for paying it off?\nAre partners involved in this? Does your spouse know? What are their details?\nWhere do you see yourself in 20 years and how does this franchise fit into that?\nWhat do you like about our franchise? Dislike?\nHow do you feel about our company culture?\nWhat sort of liquid cash can you acquire?\nWhen do you think you\u2019ll be profitable?\nGreat Franchise sales VP\u2019s know that the questionnaire only paints part of the picture. Consider To Sell Is Human; everybody sells themselves to some degree. Many who might not be a good fit for your brand will \u201csell\u201d themselves. So they look excellent on paper, but they\u2019re not the right fit for your brand when you meet them. Ideally, the questionnaire helps you to foster and generate genuine face-to-face or \u201cdiscovery\u201d meetings because there\u2019s a critical human element. The conversation \u201cfilter\u201d which you apply during the discovery interview will help determine the quality of this prospect\u2019s social fit. You can be creative with questionnaire structure to produce higher quality discovery meetings.\nHow do you qualify franchise leads before the discovery meeting? Maybe Chick-fil-A has the answer: They proactively scout leads which fit criteria in a given community and reach out directly. Their model is unique in the industry but commendable; they use deductive investigation to pre-qualify leads, which is likely why it\u2019s so hard to be a franchisee of this brand. Chick-fil-a scouts a community and figures out which member within that community will have the best long-term cultural fit. Then they help this potential franchisee bring a new Chick-fil-a to this new member\u2019s community.\nIf leads pass their rigorous community qualifications and all the standard franchisee qualifications to become part of the Chick-fil-A team, a store is built. Chick-fil-A is different in that they look for the human element first, and then follow with the questionnaire. As VP of sales, you can learn from this creative strategy.\nNo matter the size of a franchise group, it is critical that franchisees are only allowed to join if they are a \u201clow-risk investment\u201d. As much as they are investing in you, you\u2019re investing in them. Questions that reveal what type of person this lead might be in the future are essential. Cultural fit is crucial, but it won\u2019t matter if the lead does not qualify financially.\nStructuring questionnaires with existing data from previous interviews can help you reduce time, aggravation, and expense during the process. Some franchise software allows you to not only design questionnaires that help optimize the refining process, but establish actionable analytics.\nGood franchise project management (PM) tools allow you to keep all this information in one place as the lead transitions to partner or \u201cgoes sideways\u201d. This helps you identify trends you missed earlier and adjust and improve your questionnaires based on the information. Good PM tools will help make your questionnaires and process be much more effective.\nYou can also plan more effectively with Franchise PM Software. Such software allows you to determine with reasonable accuracy how much time it takes for you to transition a lead from one segment of the sales process to the next.\nFrequently, this process is so nebulous, franchisors are guessing with their gut. That can work--or blow up in your face\u2014it\u2019s far better to put numbers behind the process and reduce negative fallout.\nAnother prime feature of effective PM software involves email campaigns that strategically engage prospective franchisees based on analytics. If you want to maintain the investment value of the lead throughout your induction process, frequent communication is key.\nCompanies can use a portal like Franchise Gator, which matches their website design, to gather these questionnaires. However, portals can be expensive, typically charging $30-$50 per lead. As a result, many companies prefer to connect with leads through their website, trade shows, or by the lead calling the sales team directly. To avoid exorbitant portal feeds, make it easy for leads to reach out through your own website.\nTrade shows are cross-functional for lead generation. Not only are you at the trade show to connect with potential customers, but you can also be generating high-quality franchise leads. Trade shows are a more organic way to connect with franchise leads and to build trust. By being on panels, speaking and showing expertise you can show how your brand makes money for the entrepreneur; the prospective lead will be more willing to learn about the brand if you are striving to educate rather than to sell.\nWhen it comes to your franchise lead questionnaire, you can\u2019t cover everything. But you can continuously hone it so that with each new candidate, you\u2019ve got a more effective questionnaire and a better process. A paper questionnaire is half the puzzle. The human element is just as important. Acquired analytics are key in assisting you to secure the right leads. The right franchise PM software does a great deal to simplify and improve the process.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T00:22:43Z", "url": "https://synuma.com/blog/franchise-lead-questionnaire-guide", "byte_size": 5569, "char_size": 5521}

{"text": "According to current practice, the Saudi trademark office requires a commercial registration certificate from local entities along with the trademark application. It is not a requirement to provide evidence of use or statement of intention to use a trademark.\nThe new trademark law has extended the subject matter of trademarks in Saudi Arabia. The law provides a non-exhaustive list of registrable trademarks. Anything with distinctive character can be a trademark, such as names, words, signatures, letters, symbols, numbers, titles, stamps, drawings, pictures, inscriptions, packaging, figurative elements, shapes or colours, groups of colours, or combinations thereof, or any sign or a group of signs used or intended to be used to distinguish the goods or services of one undertaking from the goods or services of another undertaking or intended to identify a service or as a certification mark in respect of goods or services.\nFor the first time in Saudi Arabia, the law has explicitly recognised smells and sounds as trademarks. The test of distinctiveness will, however, be applicable in each case, which may be strictly applied in the case of non-conventional trademarks. Presently there is no standard approach to three-dimensional trademarks other than in some cases (eg, shapes of bottles are registered in Saudi Arabia). In the new law, the inclusion of the term \u2018packaging\u2019 in the subject matter of a trademark seems to be an attempt to include three-dimensional marks.\nmarks that contain the following words or phrases: \u2018Patent\u2019, \u2018Patented\u2019, \u2018Registered\u2019, \u2018Registered drawing\u2019 or \u2018copyright\u2019 or similar words and phrases.\nIn practice, certain goods and services, inter alia, having religious connotation such as a Christmas tree, or prohibited under shariah law, for example, bars, dance clubs and any product or service with a reference to alcohol cannot be covered under trademark registration.\nIn Saudi Arabia, common law rights are not recognised. Trademark rights are acquired only after registration of trademarks. The quasi-judicial bodies and courts in Saudi Arabia are reluctant to recognise unregistered trademark rights. The exception to this rule is only for well-known trademarks. There is a heavy burden of proof upon the claimant of a well-known mark to establish the fame of a mark in Saudi Arabia, and the law specifies the requirement. The fame of a trademark will be determined by different factors, including the recognition of the mark in the eyes of the consumers concerned, the length of the period of use or registration in the case of a registered mark, the number of international registrations and the commercial impact it has produced in the markets.\nIf a claimant is able to provide sufficient evidence in court, rights over an unregistered well-known mark can be recognised.\nThe online registration process in Saudi Arabia is relatively fast track. The registration process from filing to issuance of registration may take up to four months. The estimated time may increase in the case of office actions issued by trademark office, which may include a condition of disclaimer, deletion of certain terms and amendment of the trademark. In the case of opposition, the estimated time may be further delayed by nine to 12 months.\nThe documentation required for filing of trademark application is legalised power of attorney up to the Saudi consulate and notarisation in case of a Saudi entity, a clear image of the trademark, priority document if priority is claimed and a commercial registration certificate for Saudi applicants in some cases. According to the online procedure, the first step is to upload a power of attorney for examination by the trademark office. After acceptance of the power of attorney, which does not usually take more than half a working day, a further process for application can be initiated. The trademark office does not consider uploading of the power of attorney as the initiation of the filing process, and this, in some (rare) cases, has the effect of missing the deadline for claiming priority. It is therefore not recommended to apply for trademarks with a priority claim on the deadline of a priority claim.\nThe total official cost from filing to registration of one trademark in one class, without opposition, is US$2,405. Attorney fees may vary.\nSaudi Arabia has adopted the international Nice Classifications. The online portal for filing applications substantially includes all goods and services as provided under the international Nice Classification. However, to ensure that prohibited goods and services are not covered by trademark applications, the Saudi trademark office has either removed some such goods or services from the online portal or the portal is programmed in such a way that it is not possible to select such prohibited goods or services, even if available.\nAs mentioned in question 2, prohibited goods or services, inter alia, include goods or services with a religious connotation, such as a Christmas tree, or those prohibited under shariah law, for example, bars, dance clubs and any product or service with a reference to alcohol.\nUnder the trademark law effective from 27 September 2016, there is provision for multi-class filings; however, the trademark office is yet to issue the procedure and cost for filing such applications.\nthere is a condition to put a disclaimer on certain descriptive terms.\nThe applicant may respond with the required amendment, and the trademark office may issue an acceptance or refusal decision. Failure to respond within the stipulated period may lead to the refusal of the trademark. It is possible, although very rare, that the trademark office may issue a second chance to amend the mark. Letters of consent or coexistence agreements generally are not acceptable. In special cases, they may be acceptable.\nSince the filing procedure from start to end is online, it is therefore usually not possible to submit arguments to the trademark office. The applicants or their legal representatives can visit the trademark office to discuss any objections raised by the trademark office, but this is not stipulated procedure.\nOnce a trademark is accepted, it is published on the website of the Ministry of Commerce and Investment, usually on the same day of acceptance. The 2016 law changed the opposition period from 90 days to 60 days. If no opposition is filed, the applicant will be asked to submit a registration fee for issuance of an online registration certificate.\nIt is not a requirement of law to provide evidence of actual use or undertaking of intention to use for filing application; therefore the applicant is not required to submit such document.\nNon-use of a registered trademark during any five-year consecutive period renders it vulnerable to cancellation action. A registered trademark can be cancelled by third-party action on the basis of non-use before a competent court.\nAn action of non-use can be defended if the registrant provides reasonable justification for non-use. Acceptable justification may be reasons beyond the control of the registrant such as during war, import sanctions or any other justifiable reason that can prove that the registrant had no intention of stopping using the registered mark. A single invoice has been accepted as sufficient evidence to defeat a non-use cancellation action in Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi trademark law does not define what constitutes \u2018use\u2019 of a trademark.\nBeing a member of the Paris Convention, Saudi Arabia grants a right of priority to applications filed in convention states within a period of six months post filing. Substantial similarity of a priority application with the application filed in Saudi Arabia and within the same class is a condition of claiming priority. Minor amendments in later trademarks are allowed.\nAn appeal can be filed against a refusal decision and also against the imposition of conditions by the trademark office, within 60 days of issuance of the refusal decision or imposition of conditions. Appeals are filed with the trademark office in writing form. Within the 30-day period for filing an appeal, the trademark committee will provide a copy of the appeal statement to the applicant for submission of a written reply within 60 days. The committee may also conduct hearings upon request filed by either party in the appeal, provided that the prescribed fee is payable by the party requesting the hearing. Fees are applicable for filing oppositions and for each hearing request.\nThe decision of the trademark committee can be appealed by the aggrieved party to the Administrative Court within a 60-day period. The Administrative Court issues a hearing notice to both parties and conducts hearings. Both parties will submit written arguments and rebuttals. There are no court fees applicable in Saudi Arabia.\nA decision of the Administrative Court can be further appealed before the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal may either reject the appeal or remand the case back to the Administrative Court, along with observations. In case of refusal of appeal, the Court of Appeal will issue a written judgment, which will be final and enforceable. There is only one hearing conducted in the Court of Appeal and that is on the day of pronouncing judgments only.\nIf a case is remanded back to the Administrative Court with observation, the Administrative Court may reconduct hearings by issuance of notice to both parties. The Administrative Court may reverse its judgment or maintain its earlier judgment. In either case, the judgment will be appealable to the Court of Appeal by the aggrieved party.\nAccepted applications are published on the website of the Ministry of Commerce and Investment for a period of 60 days. Within this period, the application is open to opposition by third parties. Under the new law, opposition can be filed with the trademark office in physical form. It is expected that an online portal may be created for filing online oppositions.\nOppositions can be filed on the basis of legal justification, which can be earlier registered trademark rights or an earlier pending application in Saudi Arabia. Oppositions can also be filed on the basis of rights established by unregistered well-known marks having fame in Saudi Arabia. Other than earlier conflicting registered trademarks or applications, it is also possible to file opposition on the basis of any legal provisions that prohibit registration of certain marks in Saudi Arabia (eg, indistinctiveness, being contrary to public order and morality, based on religious connotations, covering prohibited goods or services, exclusionary subject matter) or challenging the competence of the applicant to acquire registration in Saudi Arabia.\nWithin the 30-day period of filing opposition, the trademark office will provide a copy of the opposition statement to the applicant for submission of a written reply within 60 days. Hearings may also be conducted upon a request filed by either party to the opposition provided that the prescribed fee is payable by the party requesting the hearing. Fees are applicable for each hearing request.\nThe decision of the trademark opposition committee can be appealed by the aggrieved party to the Administrative Court within a 30-day period. The decision of the Administrative Court can be further appealed before the Court of Appeal.\nThe procedure for adjudication of a dispute by the Administrative Court and Court of Appeal is discussed in question 8.\nIt is possible to challenge the existing registration of a trademark. A cancellation action can be initiated within a period of five years of registration by any concerned party on the basis of a prior use claim and by proving that registration was not acquired in good faith or on the plea that the trademark was not lawfully registered. Such actions will, however, not be maintainable after completion of five years of registration and use with no legal action commenced against such registration.\nIn cancellation actions initiated by the owners of well-known marks, the extent of their fame in Saudi Arabia has to be established. Other than a case initiated on the basis of a well-known mark, it is very difficult to cancel a registered trademark in Saudi Arabia on the basis of earlier unregistered trademark rights.\nThe total inclusive fee for opposition before trademark committee may be in a range of US$2,000 to 2,500. The attorney fee for a cancellation action in court may range from US$15,000 to US$25,000. There are no court fees in Saudi Arabia.\nThe duration of trademark registration is for 10 hijrah years. The hijrah (lunar) year applicable in Saudi Arabia is 11 days shorter than the Gregorian year. To maintain registration, the registrant shall file renewal during the last year of expiry. There is a six-month grace period post expiry of trademark, with an additional fee payable as penalty. After the six-month grace period, the trademark will be declared cancelled and further renewals will not be possible. As per Saudi trademark law, an expired mark cannot be registered in favour of any third party for a period of three years post expiry or cancellation.\nUse of the trademark is required in order to avoid non-use cancellation action by any third parties. Continuous non-use for five consecutive years makes a registered mark vulnerable to cancellation action. Saudi trademark law does not define \u2018use\u2019; however, in a true legal sense, a registered trademark will be considered as used if the registered trademark or substantially similar mark is used on all or any of the goods and services covered under the registration.\nA single invoice has been accepted as sufficient evidence of use to defeat a non-use cancellation action in Saudi Arabia.\nthere are no common-law rights. The only exception is well-known marks, which places a heavy burden of proof upon a claimant to declare the mark as well known in Saudi Arabia.\nRecordal of a trademark licence with the trademark office is optional in Saudi Arabia. Under the new trademark law, non-recordal does not have any legal detriment. From the point of view of enforcement of trademark in relation to third parties, it is always advisable to record a licence agreement for easy recognition of the licensee\u2019s right to legal action by the Saudi courts.\nRecordal of licence also provides better protection to the licensee. A licensee of a recorded licence can object to the removal of a licence from the trademark register on proper grounds.\nA registered trademark can be assigned, wholly or partly, to any third party competent to acquire a registered trademark in Saudi Arabia. A trademark may be assigned with or without goodwill. Ownership of a registered trademark can also be transferred by will and succession.\nIn order to make a trademark assignment effective in relation to a third party, it is mandatory to record the assignment with the trademark office.\nIn transactions of transfer of ownership of actual business or investment projects, trademarks have been declared as an integral part of such transactions; however, even in such cases, it is not mandatory to assignment the trademark; the parties to transactions can agree otherwise.\ncertified Arabic translation of power of attorney.\nTrademark assignment is examined by the trademark office and published in the Online Gazette. After publication, a trademark certificate is issued in the name of the assignee. This whole process may take up to two months, occasionally delayed.\nSaudi trademark law provides that in order to make the assignment of a trademark effective in relation to a third party, it is mandatory to record the assignment with the trademark office. The consequence of non-recordal of assignment is clearly provided in the law. As far as validity of assignment is concerned, it cannot be effected owing to non-recordal. However, it is in the interest of both assignor and assignee to record the assignment with the trademark office.\nSecurity interest is recognised and notarised, or legalised security interest can be recorded against a registered trademark. Security interest, unless recorded with the trademark office and published, shall not be deemed effective in relation to third parties.\nThe law does not provide any marking as such. In practice, however, it is common to use the \u00ae sign for a registered trademark. For an indication of trademark use, the \u2122 symbol is used; however, this is not common practice in Saudi Arabia. Use of the \u00ae sign provides an indication to other parties that the mark is exclusively registered and not free to use. However, use of the \u00ae sign is not a requirement to initiate infringement action, and non-use cannot be pleaded as a defence against infringement if otherwise infringement is established.\nIndication of an unregistered mark as a registered mark is a punishable offence in Saudi trademark law; therefore use of the \u00ae sign for an unregistered mark may be risky from this perspective.\nThere are two types of proceedings available in Saudi Arabia for trademark infringement actions: administrative action and court action.\nAdministrative action can be initiated before the Anti Commercial Fraud Department (ACFD) in Riyadh. The ACFD has recently introduced a centralised complaint management system, and therefore a complaint can be filed with the ACFD headquarters in Riyadh against infringement occurring in any Saudi city. The ACFD requires evidence of infringement in the form of a sample of genuine and infringing products, purchase bills from outlets selling infringing products and the address of the location. The process includes submission of an online complaint along with evidence, study of the case by the ACFD, raids on outlets offering infringing products and destruction of the infringing products.\nAlthough the ACFD operates under its own law (Anti Commercial Fraud Law), in some of the court\u2019s judgments trademark infringement cases were dismissed and plaintiffs were advised to first resort to administrative procedure. The court also stated in its (debatable) judgment that any trademark infringement case will be premature and not maintainable if, prior to filing an infringement action, administrative action was not taken by the trademark owners. Administrative procedures are usually speedy, and in cases of prima facie infringement ACFD inspectors may conclude complaints within a two-month period.\nApart from administrative action, trademark infringement actions can also be filed with commercial courts in Saudi Arabia. In each type of action, registration of trademark is a precondition for success. Unregistered rights are not recognised in Saudi Arabia except in the case of well-known trademarks, in which case the plaintiff is under a heavy burden of proof.\nBorder control measures are considered as a very effective approach in Saudi Arabia. The customs authorities in Saudi Arabia have set up a procedure to record registered trademarks with customs for vigilance in all upcoming consignments of imports into Saudi Arabia. The customs authorities will stop, either on their own suspicion or by request filed by trademark owner, any suspected shipment, and will contact the registered trademark owner or its legal representative to confirm whether the suspected held products are genuine or counterfeit. Customs authorities are cooperative in this procedure and usually share pictures of suspected products very quickly and, where required, samples are also provided for the purpose of confirmation.\nIn any case, the trademark owner is obliged to initiate a case before a competent court within 10 days for the issuance of the order to destroy the imported goods or remove them from the channel of business. Goods harmful to public health and the environment are usually destroyed.\nknowingly possessing tools or material intended to be used in the imitation of registered trademarks or famous trademarks.\nInfringement proceedings are initiated by submitting a statement of claims to a competent court, or an online complaint before the administrative authority in the case of administrative action. In court proceedings, statements of claims will be served upon the defendants with instructions to submit a written statement on the date of the scheduled hearing. In Saudi Arabia, litigation is conducted through an exchange of written documents and oral arguments. In the case of technical matters, the judge can appoint an expert to submit his or her advice on any specific issue, although it is not the usual practice of courts. Oral testimony is acceptable as evidence. The case is decided by a presiding judge.\nCriminal proceedings in trademark cases are initiated by a public prosecutor upon the recommendation of the ACFD. Saudi criminal procedure law is applicable to all criminal proceedings.\nIn Saudi Arabia trademark rights are acquired through registration; therefore a registration certificate is sine qua non to bring an infringement action. It is also the duty of the plaintiff to establish confusing similarity. In the case of unregistered well-known trademarks, the plaintiff is under an additional burden to prove that the mark is famous. The new trademark law stipulates the criteria for establishing the fame of a trademark, which are the extent of its recognition by the concerned consumers as a result of its promotion, the length of period of registration or use thereof, the number of countries of registration or fame or the value of the mark and the extent of its impact in the promotion of goods or services that the mark is used to distinguish.\nIn any action based on a well-known mark, all the above elements shall be proved by the plaintiff. If a well-known mark is actually used in Saudi Arabia, it is usually very convincing in proceedings.\nThe owner of a registered trademark or a licensee, authorised under agreement to do so, may bring a civil trademark infringement action if any third party has commercially exploited the registered trademark without authorisation. A criminal complaint may be initiated by the ACFD if, inter alia, the trademark infringement also has elements of fraud to consumers. The ACFD may initiate such actions suo moto or on a complaint submitted by the rights holder. In the latter case, the ACFD will examine the presence of criminal elements independently.\nIn such cases, foreign activities outside Saudi Arabia should establish cause of action in Saudi Arabia. Any unauthorised exploitation of registered trademarks through activities done outside the jurisdiction of Saudi Arabia will establish actionable cause if such goods are attempted to be imported into Saudi Arabia. The Saudi customs department has a strong mechanism of border control. Any suspected infringing or counterfeit goods are seized at the border, either by a complaint or on the initiative of customs officials. The customs officials will communicate with the rights holder or its authorised representative (recorded with custom) to confirm the status of the seized goods. In the case of counterfeit goods, the consignment is seized at the border and the customs department will initiate a procedure to destroy the goods or remove them from commercial channels.\nThere are no legal provisions in place for a discovery procedure. In practice, discovery of fact or discovery of documents is not possible in legal proceedings. The judge can, however, depending on the circumstances, ask any party to produce certain documents, but the law does not oblige litigating parties to produce them.\nThe time frame for litigation varies from case to case. Preliminary injunction proceedings can be concluded within two months. At trial level, it may take 12 to 16 months. Appeals before the Court of Appeal are usually concluded within four to six months.\nAdministrative infringement actions can be concluded within three to four months.\nA typical infringement action may cost from US$15,000 to US$25,000 before Saudi courts. Administrative actions before ACFD usually cost from US$5,000 to US$7,000.\nThe award of damages is possible only in theory. Although Saudi trademark law has provisions on the award of damages, the Saudi courts follow shariah (Islamic) principles on damages. Under the Islamic principle, the damages should be actual, quantifiable and not based on speculation. Reputational damages are not recognised under this principle. The heavy burden of proof upon the plaintiff makes it difficult to establish damages to the satisfaction of the court, and in practice damages are not awarded.\nIn infringement and cancellation actions, the decision of the first instance court can be appealed by the aggrieved party before the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal may either reject the appeal or remand the case back to the first instance court along with observations. In the case of a refusal of appeal, the Court of Appeal will issue a written judgment, which will be final and enforceable.\nSee questions 8 and 9 for the appeal process in trademark refusals and opposition proceedings.\nif the infringement action is brought by the owner of unregistered well-known marks, the defendant can dispute the fame of the well-known mark in Saudi Arabia.\nA successful infringement case, whether administrative or in court, can end up in the issuance of an order to destroy the infringing goods. The actual damages and lost profits can be considered for apportionment of monetary relief, but in practice this is rarely granted. Award of damages or monetary relief is possible only in theory. Although Saudi trademark law has provisions on the award of damages, Saudi courts follow shariah principles on damages. Under the Islamic principle, the damages should be actual, quantifiable and not based on speculation. Reputational damages are not recognised under this principle. The heavy burden of proof upon the plaintiff makes it difficult to establish damages to the satisfaction of the court, and in practice damages or monetary relief are not awarded.\nInterim injunctions are available in law, but in practice hardly granted by Saudi courts. Application for interim injunctions should be based on a prima facie case, which should include proof of trademark registration, and prima facie infringement of the registered trademark. Where the nature of imitation is such that a question of similarity between the marks may be subject to consideration, an interim injunction will not be granted.\nDepending on the offence committed, monetary punishments can be between 1,000 and 1 million Saudi riyals. A recidivist can be punished with double punishments as provided for specific offences and reoffending may also lead to temporary closure of his or her business.\nADR is highly encouraged under Islamic principles. Mediation and arbitration between parties to disputes is encouraged in all forms of litigation and has strong roots in shariah law and traditions.\nArbitration in Saudi Arabia is governed under the new Law of Arbitration, issued by Royal Decree No. M/34, which is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on international commercial arbitration, although not a verbatim adoption. Under this law, parties can exclude the jurisdiction of Saudi courts to take cognisance of a dispute between parties. Recourse to arbitration may save the parties time in a dispute and they may select a specialised arbitrator who has the relevant knowledge and skill to settle a dispute. The parties can adopt the language of the proceedings and place of arbitration. A notable concern is that the provisions of an arbitration agreement, either separately executed or by reference in a main agreement, cannot exclude the jurisdiction of Saudi courts on the invalidation proceedings of awards. The law provides a list of provisions for bringing an invalidation action; therefore, bearing in mind the Saudi legal system, there is always an element of uncertainty in the enforcement of awards, especially where the arbitration was held outside Saudi Arabia or by application of a non-Saudi law.\nSaudi trademark law has provisions on criteria to establish a well-known trademark. According to the law, the fame of the mark shall be determined by the extent of its recognition by the concerned consumers as a result of its promotion, the length of period of registration or use thereof, the number of countries of registration or the fame or the value of the mark and the extent of its impact in the promotion of goods or services which the mark is used to distinguish.\nSubject to the above provisions, a well-known trademark can be enforced against infringers if the use of the mark were to indicate a connection between the goods or services required to be distinguished by it and the goods or services of the owner of the well-known mark or the use of the mark would lead to the possibility of damage to the owner of the well-known mark.\nSaudi courts also recognise provisions of multilateral intellectual property conventions and agreements relating to well-known marks.\nwell-known marks, whether registered or unregistered, are enforceable against a third party\u2019s infringement.\nthe Saudi government announced the establishment of a new IP Authority in March 2017. The Saudi Intellectual Property Authority (SIPA) is considered one of the initiatives of the Trade and Investment System within the National Transformation Program 2020. The Trade and Investment System has worked to bring SIPA into existence and has set up the regularity arrangements to enable the authority to achieve its objectives.

{"text": "How to locate advice you can trust.\nCredit counseling is a fine idea. The government thinks so highly of it that the law now requires you to get credit counseling within six months of filing for bankruptcy.\nTrouble is, the field has more than its share of shady operators who charge hidden fees, misrepresent their nonprofit status and offer questionable advice. Now a new source can steer you to a reputable counselor. The U.S. Trustee's office vets credit-counseling agencies and lists 132 approved firms in the Credit Counseling & Debtor Education section of its Web site. You'll find contact information and Web addresses, plus you can see if a firm does business in person, over the phone or online.\nLook for fees of $50 or less (sessions limited to budgeting generally cost less than $20). A counselor meets with you for 60 to 90 minutes, reviews your financial situation and offers budgeting advice. Avoid agencies that press you to enter a debt-management program, under which you give your bills and payments to the agency, which in turn pays your creditors and negotiates debt relief, if necessary. Some agencies focus on this arrangement because creditors pay them to sign up consumers.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T10:55:16Z", "url": "http://wwa.kiplinger.com/article/credit/T025-C000-S002-honest-credit-repair.html", "byte_size": 1197, "char_size": 1197}
{"text": "When I visited New Zealand in 2015, I spent the majority of my time in Christchurch. The primary reason for my trip to the area was to attend a Geocaching Mega Event in the area known as Kaiapoi. I spent nine days in and around Christchurch exploring the city and the countryside.\nI will cover most of the main area\u2019s I visited in Christchurch in this post. However, there are a couple of posts that I have previously shared a little about my time in Christchurch. I will list them below if you want to read more about my time in Christchurch.\nI visited Hagley Park on numerous occasions while in Christchurch, both as a place to walk and to find a few Geocaches. The park itself is almost like a break or buffer between the Christchurch CBD and the suburb of Riccarton.\nThere are many large trees throughout the park and many beautiful gardens. There is even a relatively shallow waterway that it is possible to kayak through as well.\nHagley Park also incorporates the Christchurch Botanical Gardens. Throughout there are many beautiful gardens full of flowers at the time that I visited.\nThe Groynes is a rather large park with many walking trails and a range of dog off leash areas. There are also some beautiful areas through the park such as this one with a tributary of the Waimakariri River running past.\nCathedral Square sits at the centre of Christchurch when you look at Christchurch on the map. Depending on the map the city name will be almost on top. It is also the place where the Christchurch Cathedral, which was badly damaged in the 2011 earthquake stands still very much damaged.\nAs you look at the buildings around the square, it can be rather difficult to see why some are barricaded off. While others show the very visible signs of the damage from the earthquake. Such as the building below which is fenced off but has no external signs of damage.\nI did not spend a lot of time in the Christchurch Central Business District. But on the one chance, I had to walk around there was a couple of interesting features that I spotted. The first was at one point when I came across this waterwheel. It does seem to be a relic of the past, but I wonder for what it might have been used.\nThere is also the Bridge of Remembrance; I am not certain if the repairs were for the bridge itself or the archway. However, it is dedicated to those who died in World War I and serves as a memory to those who participated in both world wars.\nOne interesting area of Christchurch that is new since the earthquake is the Renew Shopping Mall. It is in this area that a lot of shipping containers have been used to rapidly build a place for the shops to operate.\nIt is an interesting area, and I wish I had been a coffee drinker at the time I visited as this might have been a good spot for coffee.\nThere is a temporary art installation which in some ways acts as a memorial to the lives lost in the 2011 Earthquake. There sits here 185 empty white chairs each one representing a life lost in the earthquake.\nWhile I was out looking for Geocaches around Christchurch, there were some amazing spots that I discovered. This particular spot is near to a location known as Sign of the Kiwi and looks down across the hills to Governors Bay.\nThe Waimakariri River runs a little to the north of Christchurch. The river flows for around 150km from the Southern Alps, across the Canterbury Plains to the Pacific Ocean. At this location, it is quite wide almost at the Pacific Ocean, but further upstream it flows in a braided fashion.\nThe city of Christchurch and the surrounding area offers so much to see and explore. What I have shared today in this post is just a fraction of what I got to see myself and a smaller fraction of what is there to explore. I just did not always have the camera out at the right times to capture everything in pictures. I know that I will return to the area one day and delve in a little deeper, especially on some of the walks and hikes.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T19:06:07Z", "url": "http://www.travelexplored.com/exploring-christchurch-new-zealand/", "byte_size": 3960, "char_size": 3958}

{"text": "Lynn Rives stands in front of the new sign bearing his name that hangs on the Environmental Education Center at the Mobbly Bayou Wilderness Preserve.\nFor nearly 20 years, Lynn Rives served as Oldsmar\u2019s leisure services director, where he was responsible for such projects as the creation of Canal Park and its renovated Supercross track, the growth of Oldsmar\u2019s expansive parks and trails system, and the construction of the Environmental Education Center at Mobbly Bayou Preserve .\nDespite his extensive list of accomplishments, officials rejected a request by City Council member Jerry Beverland to name a city facility in Rives\u2019 honor prior to his retirement last March, a decision that sat just fine with the designated honoree.\n\u201cI told (Jerry) I really wasn\u2019t interested in it anyway,\u201d Rives said in January of 2017.\nFlash-forward a year and Rives is still alive and well; in fact, he\u2019s currently serving as the City Manager of his hometown, Belleair Beach.\nHowever, after being gone for 12 months, Oldsmar officials decided the time was right to officially name the center after Rives.\nThe City of Oldsmar dedicated the Environmental Education Center at Mobbly Bayou Preserve in honor of longtime Leisure Services Director Lynn Rives, who retired in 2017 after nearly 20 years with the city.\n\u201cThe City of Oldsmar likes to consider ourselves on the leading edge where we name things after people before they pass away,\u201d City Manager Al Braithwaite joked to open the dedication ceremony on Monday, Mar. 12.\nBraithwaite then handed the microphone to Oldsmar Mayor Doug Bevis who listed several notable accomplishments from Rives\u2019 tenure, which began in September 1999, including: opening the original Oldsmar BMX track and converting it into an Olympic-caliber Supercross facility; developing Richard Rogers Park, the Cypress Forest Recreation Center and Veterans Memorial Park; and opening Mobbly Bayou Wilderness Preserve, which includes a dog park, a zipline aerial adventure park and the Environmental Education Center.\n\u201cThis building was erected in 2016 under his supervision and includes a solar panel on the roof that helped achieve one of the many council priorities he was given,\u201d Bevis said of the facility, which he called \u201ca major undertaking\u201d that included hoisting the hefty wooden beams that support the roof into place.\nOldsmar Mayor Doug Bevis notes the heavy wooden beams that make up the Environmental Education Center ceiling during the facility\u2019s dedication ceremony in Lynn Rives\u2019 honor on Monday, Mar. 12, 2018.\n\u201cProbably with the exception of the concrete work and the beams being set in here, our city staff did this entire project. So congratulations to Lynn and his staff for pulling that off.\nBevis concluded by saying \u201cthank you to Lynn for the numerous other projects he spearheaded to help put our city on the map where it is today\u201d before he directed the group to the front of the facility for the unveiling of the sign.\nFollowing the reveal, Rives spoke about receiving the (slightly delayed) honor.\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy. It\u2019s a very nice thing to do and I really appreciate it,\u201d he told Oldsmar Connect.\nOldsmar officials dodge flying metal clips during the unveiling of the sign dedicating the Lynn Rives Environmental Education Center on Monday, Mar. 12, 2018.\nDespite his initial reluctance to have something named after him, Rives admitted it was special to see his name on this facility.\nBraithwaite and Rives\u2019 successor, Felicia Donnelly, also commented after the ceremony.\n\u201cHe is an amazing go-getter,\u201d Braithwaite, who started his career with the city at the same time as Rives, said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone who gets things done as well as he does.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T16:07:54Z", "url": "http://oldsmarconnect.com/oldsmar-renames-environmental-education-center-honor-lynn-rives/", "byte_size": 3745, "char_size": 3689}
{"text": "Gail Reid: When Rhoda Janzen is injured in a car accident shortly after her husband of 15 years dumps her for a man, she postpones her sabbatical and returns to the comfort of her parents' California home. Her parents are leaders of the Mennonite church so the worldly Rhoda's return to her Mennonite roots is a distinctly different kind of memoir.\nThis story evokes themes from Elizabeth Gilbert's \"Eat, Pray, Love\" as well as a humorous response to everything reminiscent of David Sedaris and Nora Ephron. What's uniquely different is the Mennonite angle. Few of us have insight into the beliefs and everyday life of this fascinating religious group.\nI don't like to bash a book that many people will, in fact, enjoy. After all, it has been on the bestseller's list for several months. However, the humor is much too caustic for me and sometimes crosses the line to mean spirited.

{"text": "T-Mobile has just rolled out a service called HotSpot @Homethat allows you to use a WiFi-enabled cell phone to make calls via a wireless network. You'll still use the phone with regular cellular airwaves while on the move, but once you're in range of a T-Mobile Hotspot or a pre-configured WiFi access point, the phone will know to automatically switch over. The best part? Call minutes made via WiFi aren't deducted from your plan. That's right -- as long as you're within range of a wireless broadband network, you'll have unlimited calls. An added benefit to this is that you're almost guaranteed great signal strength when you're in a place with good WiFi coverage. And since T-Mobile is providing special T-Mobile configured D-Link and Linksys wireless routers that offer optimal @Home coverage, you might as well say Sayonara to that old-fashioned landline at home.\nCompatible handsets at launch are the Samsung T409 and the Nokia 6086, which cost $49.99 each with a contract. When you sign up with the service, you'll get one of the aforementioned wireless routers for free after rebate, but any 802.11b-compatible router should work. The service is an additional $9.99 per month on top of your existing T-Mobile plan, and an additional $19.99 per month on family plans that have up to five handsets. Personally, I think it's a pretty cool idea, though I don't know if such a service will make up for the fact that T-Mobile has yet to roll out a proper 3G service like the rest of its competitors. We currently have the Samsung t409 plus a Hotspot-configured Linksys router in house, and will let you know what we think of it soon.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T04:34:28Z", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/t-mobiles-hotspothome-lets-you-makes-calls-via-wifi/", "byte_size": 1638, "char_size": 1638}

Your arguments are valid and logical and EY is apparently hoping they can exhaust people and get away with changing fare rules.\nI was planning on using the email which I received from Etihad that explicitly stated that no changes are involved unless difference in fare is paid. In fact, the call center agent also mentioned that I should have received communication that no changes are allowed, so it has to be recorded in the PNR somewhere.\nI will file a DOT complaint as soon as I arrive in the US, assuming the CDG-DFW flight doesn't screw up. Not sure if AA can check me in if my flight coupon is marked \"NOGO\".\nAny guesses from our lawyers out there how long this can continue to go on for? is there ever a time when a court can say enough is enough, go away!\nwhich court is the highest they can appeal to? if they get denied by them can they appeal an appeal decision. I'm pretty sure once the US Supreme Court rules you can't appeal it or am I mistaken. Not sure if it's the same deal in Canada.\n1) I am not a lawyer.\n2) I do not have a Swiss fare so I am not part of the legal action.\n3) I have a deep personal interest in how Canada works the way it does. So over the years I've tried to learn more about the governance of the nation. I don't consider myself an expert on this any more than I consider myself an expert on methods to accrue miles. I simply know more about this stuff than an average person does.\n4) I have some friends who did purchase the fare. One of them emailed me last night to get my opinion on the pdf letter from Davis. He then suggested I post here to add to the general discussion.\nSo that said ... A Stay is basically a pause in legal proceedings. So Davis (a large Canadian law firm) is apparently now acting on behalf of Swiss. They are asking for a pause in the legal proceedings.\nSection 1(A) just regurgitates why a Stay is permissible.\nSections 1(B) and (C) are clear. It\u2019s very worth noting though that the Federal Court of Appeal has denied Swiss leave to appeal. More on that later.\nSection 1(D) is interesting. To understand the role of Governor-in-Council, you need to understand the governance of Canada and specifically some provisions of the Constitution Act and related Acts that came before.\nCanada is a constitutional monarchy. So the Crown (Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II) is the head of state. (This is an important distinction from say, the American way where the President is head of state. Here, our Prime Minister is merely head of government, but he technically reports to Her Majesty who is head of state.) At the pleasure of Her Majesty, a government may be formed. The Governor General of Canada (David Johnston) is the Crown\u2019s direct representative in Canada and is tasked with the day-to-day job of running the country and making sure that only important stuff is filtered up to Her Majesty. Direction / wisdom on certain issues will be sought from the Crown as required.\nIn order to help decide which issues are important (and need Crown input), the GG appoints (for life!) learned persons to the Privy Council. In theory, a member of the Privy Council - specifically one who commands the confidence of the House of Commons - is selected to be the Prime Minister. The PM then requests the GG to appoint select individuals to a special sub-committee of the Privy Council. This special sub-committee is known as Cabinet. Cabinet Ministers are Members of Parliament who carry special duties (& privileges) such as being the head of Foreign Affairs, or Finance Minister etc. In theory, the Crown and the GG will only take direction from this particular group. So Cabinet is also technically known as the Queen-in-Council or more commonly the Governor-in-Council.\nThe \u201cin-Council\u201d bit is important because this is where an Order-in-Council comes from. Laws in Canada are created first from Bills which need to move through debate in Parliament (various readings in the House) then to the Senate for \u201csober second thought\u201d then finally to the Crown for Royal Assent. The Crown however, retains ultimate power in Canada. So the Crown can simply pass an Order-in-Council and something can come into being (from a judicial / legislative perspective) without having to go through the long route of passing something into law. Theoretically the Governor-in-Council will draft an Order-in-Council in front of the Crown, then read it out loud. The Queen will simply say \u201cApproved\u201d and the Order comes into immediate effect.\nSo an Order-in-Council is basically a quick & dirty way of bringing something into effect without having to rewrite laws. For example, the various prostitution laws were recently found un-Constitutional (i.e. illegal) by the Supreme Court. The Government could have sought an Order-in-Council that would essentially still leave prostitution illegal, while keeping an illegal law still embedded in the Criminal Code. Technically possible, but clearly not the best course of action.\nSo what\u2019s happened in this case is that Swiss has petitioned the Governor-in-Council, to pretty please draft an Order-in-Council that will essentially let Swiss break the law, without actually having to re-write the laws of Canada.\nNow, presumably the Federal Court has heard arguments from Swiss and from peeps like you. The Federal Court presumably told Swiss thanks for coming out, now go away and have a nice life.\nSwiss applied for leave (permission) to appeal that decision. As Section 1(C) notes, the Federal Court of Appeal told Swiss thanks for coming out, now go away and have a nice life.\nSo that\u2019s it. There are no more court arguments for Swiss and they are obligated to uphold whatever decision was initially made by the Federal Court. But, there is the possibility that they could get an Order-in-Council. Which is clearly what they\u2019re hoping to do.\nBut an Order-in-Council is something to be used sparingly. It's a very special device which really should not be used at will.\nAn interesting wrinkle here is that there is no timeline associated with requesting an Order-in-Council. Typically it\u2019s something so important and of national significance that it needs to be dealt with fairly quickly. Canadian passports for example are only made available to Canadian citizens. But when the US hostages were taken in Iran, then Prime Minister Joe Clark did a behind the scenes Order-in-Council that permitted issuing Canadian passports to those US citizens who Ambassador Ken Taylor got out with help from the CIA.\nClearly, the Swiss thing is not in the same league as rescuing hostages. So what may happen is that the Governor-in-Council may sit on this and do absolutely nothing. And then Parliament will be dissolved, an election called and a new Cabinet selected and sworn in. At which point in time I suspect Swiss will make another petition to the new Governor-in-Council.\nFrom the perspective of Swiss, this would make sense because it would allow them infinite delays. I would, in a way, be surprised if the Governor-in-Council responds to the Swiss request because the matter is so trivial. If they respond, they set the precedent that any entity can seek an Order-in-Council. This is already true (anyone can seek an Order), but it\u2019s a gross abuse of the executive function of Cabinet by trying to bog them down in such an inconsequential matter. The Swiss application deserves to be ignored by the Governor-in-Council.\nBut that\u2019s the way of large corporations. Theoretically what this might do is clarify when an Order can be sought, but it\u2019s awful hard to write something like that into law plus it probably requires an amendment to the Constitution which just ain\u2019t gonna happen.\nPractically what will most likely happen - eventually the CTA will stop granting Stays, at which point Swiss will accuse the CTA of not obeying their own rules (\u201cpending the disposition of a petition to the Governor in Council\u201d) and some weird legal stuff will happen and eventually Swiss will be forced to honour the fares. By this time though, many people will have moved, died or just plain forgotten about the fare.\nHope this helps. If anyone out there is truly an expert, please feel free to correct any mistakes I may have made!\nWow. Awesome analysis. Thanks for the write up!\nHoping CTA will finally say \"no more stays\"\nI assume that the 80 names are a total of all who have filed? I was part of the group who received LET-C-A-3-2014 dated January 22, 2014. I have received nothing today.\nYou're on the list of 80 people attached to yesterday's letter.\nThanks a lot for the insights, truly appreciate it.\nQuestion: what's the repercussion if CTA finally decides not to grant Stays? I know LX will make a big noise about it, but other than that, what will happen next?\nSo in essence, because an order-in-council is so special and rarely used, LX can attempt to drag this out for the next 50 years?\nSo much great information for us politico buffs! Thanks!\nI missed that you had that letter.\nI'm honestly surprised no one else received the same unsolicited email. Makes me wonder if sending it out 36h before my departure was by design and not coincidence.\nThat was fascinating, RCyyz. Thank you for writing so clearly and bringing a much better understanding to the proceedings.\nReading stuff like this makes getting up in the morning worth it (and yes, I have a full time job, which means that yes, I am saying that getting up for a full-time job is NOT worth it).\nThank you for writing this. This is a VERY intriguing perspective.\nI can see LX and council hoping that it can drag on forever.\nI would love to hear an answer to this question, because this morning the Agency denied Swiss' motion to stay 416/417, and ordered Swiss to compensate me by March 17 and fly the rest of the 7 over the next year! Not sure as of yet how this applies to other merged complaints. Tariff Rule 5F is also finally disallowed as of February 21st.\nc/o Heather L. Treacy, Q.C.\nparagraph 28 of Decision No. 417-C-A-2013.\nand (3) the balance of convenience must favour Swiss.\nparagraph 28 of Decision No. 417-C-A-2013?\n\u201cIrreparable\u201d refers to the nature of the harm suffered rather than its magnitude.\ncured, usually because one party cannot collect damages from the other.\nparty....\u201d Swiss has not provided any argument in regards to the balance of inconvenience.\nan erroneous fare, including compensation for expenses incurred due to ticket cancellation.\nlater than February 16, 2015.\nIf you have any questions regarding the foregoing, you may Contact [redacted][/email].\nDunno. I'm not a lawyer! But the CTA is a Crown agency that operates under the auspices of the Governor-in-Council. So essentially, the CTA is a representative of Her Majesty the Queen. LX can make whatever noise they want but ultimately Her Majesty outranks them, at least in a Canadian judicial / legislative perspective.\nBasically if Her Majesty chooses to ignore her own rules, there's nothing anyone can do about it other than stage a coup and cut off her head. I somehow doubt LX will succeed at that!\nSo if CTA does not grant a stay, I think LX will simply have to uphold whatever decision was made at the Federal Court.\nActually Council would not want to drag this out. As I said, the Swiss application for an Order-in-Council is a gross abuse of the executive function of Cabinet. Personally as a Canadian, I am enormously insulted that Swiss - a foreign entity - would deign to attempt something like this. While what they are doing is legal, it's certainly of questionable moral integrity and as I said, an abuse of the system.\nSo the Governor-in-Council most likely wants nothing at all to do with this. They probably wish LX would just go away. Behind the scenes, the Minister of Transport may in fact be directing the head of the CTA to figure out how to not grant a Stay. That's certainly what I would do if I was Minister of Transport!\nAnyhow, glad my comments seem to have helped a bit!", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T04:49:04Z", "url": "https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/mileage-run-discussion/1392131-prem-fare-gone-rgn-first-class-comes-back-again-659.html", "byte_size": 14144, "char_size": 14102}

{"text": "Thanks to D&B Credit, Swisslog masters its international project business - both on the supplier and customer side.\n\"We finally got what we've been talking about for years.\" For Bruno Zingg, Head of Strategic Purchasing at Swisslog, the introduction of D&B Credit was a great relief in many respects. The predecessor product e-Portfolio lacked many essential functions. \"If someone made a credit report, the others had no access to it,\" recalls Zingg. D&B Credit has eliminated these and many other weaknesses. It is web-based and makes it possible to work in a team and share reports and information, according to the preferences of Bruno Zingg.\nSwisslog is the leading provider of automation solutions for hospitals and is also active in logistics automation. Swisslog is therefore active in the area of project business and does not manufacture any series products.\nFor Bruno Zingg, it is crucial in this context that everything runs smoothly. Because every supplier who does not deliver runs the risk of endangering an entire project. For this reason, Swisslog keeps a close eye on all suppliers and obtains information in D&B Credit on the financials of these companies. If, for example, you place an order worth CHF 1 million and according to D&B Credit the credit recommendation is CHF 50 000, this corresponds to a factor of 1 : 20 - the supplier automatically receives a red flag. In such a case Swisslog requires payment and execution guarantees. Thus they want to prevent the loss of the deposit in case of bankruptcy of the supplier.\n\"D&B Credit is a very good solution for us because we get exactly the right information for the financial risk rating, both on the supplier side and for the customers that we have to assess in the course of the project business.\"\n\"In the case of larger projects, we consider at an early stage which suppliers might be considered for implementation,\" explains Zingg. Each of these suppliers undergoes a thorough check, regardless of whether they are already working with him or whether he is still unknown. To do this, Swisslog checks its financial position and generates the necessary credit reports in D&B Credit. If a supplier appears to be in a bad position, he is out of the question for cooperation.\nSwisslog is active all over the world. The teams that handle the projects on site are located at 12 locations in Europe, America, Asia and Oceania. \"I definitely have to rely on the local project buyers,\" says Bruno Zingg. As Head of Strategic Purchasing, he does not handle the projects himself. It is his men at the various locations who manage the demand for the projects. Accordingly, they are the ones who work with D&B Credit and create reports. Zingg fully relies on the local people and that they always have the necessary information at hand and are able to make the right decisions. One of the most important aspects are the financial risks based on the credit reports that the teams receive from D&B Credit.\n\"Yes, we are very satisfied with D&B Credit,\" reveals Bruno Zingg. He managed the business with e-Portfolio and has since looked at several other solutions from other vendors. He had noticed that his competitors also used Dun & Bradstreet's data. This showed him that D&B was the market leader in the quantity and quality of credit information processed worldwide. \"No one else does that on this scale,\" Zingg explains.\nThe group view: If an employee makes a report, it is also available to all others.\nSimple user administration: Swisslog controls access centrally.\nUser Guides: New employees learn how to use D&B Credit very quickly thanks to the extensive documentation.\nInternational: Information such as Payment Index or Credit Rating is harmonised in D&B Credit. This ensures that everyone speaks the same language in an international context.\nFamily Tree: With just one click you can see the business connections of your business partners and have better cards in your hand during negotiations.\nWas it difficult to switch from e-portfolio to D&B Credit? \"No, it was much more a relief. Now we finally have it the way we imagined it would be,\" is how Bruno Zingg sums up the change Swisslog successfully made a good year ago.\nD&B Credit is the risk platform of the latest generation that takes modern credit management to a new level. It directly taps the largest global company database with Dun & Bradstreet\u2019s state-of-the-art scoring models.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T00:22:48Z", "url": "https://www.bisnode.ch/en-ch/about-bisnode/our-customers/swisslog/", "byte_size": 4422, "char_size": 4420}

{"text": "Winter, Secretary of the NAVY v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.\nThe US Navy was using mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar during its training exercises off the coast of southern California. The plaintiffs argued that the use of sonar causes serious injuries to marine mammals and sued the Navy, asking for declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that the Navy had violated NEPA by conducting harmful sonar training without having first prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The District Court granted the injunction after determining that the plaintiffs had shown a probability of success on their NEPA and CZMA claims. The court of appeals upheld the injunction because the negative impact of the injunction on the Navy was considered speculative, and because the balance of hardships and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The Navy filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court rules that the standard for granting an injunction used by the lower court (requiring only a possibility of irreparable harm) was too lenient. But even if the plaintiffs could have shown that there was a likelihood of irreparable harm (the correct standard), this was outweighed by the public and Navy\u2019s interest in effective and realistic training. Deference must be given to the military with regard to the relative importance of a particular military interest.\nThe preliminary injunction is vacated to the extent challenged by the Navy. The balance of equities and the public interest tip strongly in favor of the Navy.

{"text": "What is a Termite Bond? What are Bonds Good For?\nWhat is a Termite Bond? What are They Good For & are Bonds Worth the Cost?\n>> What is a Termite Bond? What are They Good For & are Bonds Worth the Cost?\nWondering how much is your termite bond?\nYou found termite damage to your house, went through the whole process of hiring an exterminator to inspect the damage, then had several treatments to take care of the problem. This shouldn\u2019t be the end of your efforts to eradicate termites from your home, however, since a house with previous termite damage is likely to experience a recurrence of the infestation at some point in the future.\nPeople in places like Alabama are fond of saying, \u201cThere are two kinds of houses: those with termites and those that will have them.\u201d How can you keep up with extermination costs that potentially recur every year? Look into the benefits of a termite bond.\nWhat is a termite bond? It is a contract or guarantee entered into between a homeowner/business owner and their exterminator. After a building is treated for termites, a bond ensures future inspection and treatment at no cost to the customer beyond the bond renewal fee.\nWill the cost of the bond amount to less than the expected expenses should reinfestation occur?\nDoes the bond cover both inspection and full retreatment?\nWill the bond cover any damages related to termites causing future damage to the house?\nAre you in an area with different kinds of termites? If so, will a bond cover all types of termites returning in the future?\nIf retreatment is needed and the new infestation is more extensive, will the company cover measures beyond the initial service (i.e. if only liquid is used the first time will they cover fumigation in the future)?\nIn order to understand how a termite bond works, you should know the basics of the termite extermination process. The first step is a thorough inspection to determine the type of termite, location of the infestation, and the extent of the damage. All of these factors taken together will determine the method used. Serious infestations usually require fumigation. In fact, a lot of title companies require fumigation before a home with any kind of termite damage is sold to a new owner. Typically, termite fumigations take around three days to complete.\nThe basic termite bond should cover a yearly inspection and, if termites return, future extermination costs. Initial extermination may be as low as $1,500 for a small area and basic treatment, and a large home with a significant problem can cost up to $5,000 to treat. In the first case, a bond fee of $200 per year may not be worth it, especially if you live in an area with infrequent infestations. Wise Geek features a concise article on termite bonds that recommends comparing the annual cost of a bond with the price of re-extermination for your house.\nYou cannot assume a termite bond will cover any and all damages caused by future infestations. Some bonds are for extermination costs only while others promise to repair a limited amount of damages to your house if the termites return within a certain time frame. The kind of termite in your house can affect the bond as well, says Orkin; if the initial treatment was for one type of termite and another kind re-infests your house, the bond may not apply. This may also be the case if the first time you have an issue in your basement, for example, but the next time find termites on the outside of your foundation.\nIf you have questions about termites bonds because you are buying or selling a house, look closely at the bond\u2019s transfer limitations. For buyers purchasing a home with a previous termite problem, make sure the bond can and is transferred to you as the new homeowner. This way you are not on the hook for extermination costs that should have been covered by the previous owner. You will, however, need to take on the responsibility of the bond\u2019s annual fees to continue the contract with the exterminator.\nAs a home seller, you should invest in a bond to increase the chances you will sell a home with termite damages. Homeowners\u2019 insurance does not cover termite damage\u2013 a reinfestation too soon after the sale of your house could leave you paying the new homeowners\u2019 extermination bills. Savvy buyers may not even consider buying from you without a bond in place. With a transferable bond, you can hand off the agreement to the new homeowner, they take on the cost of the bond, and you don\u2019t have to worry about the termites coming back to a home you no longer own.\nIf you\u2019ve recently had your home exterminated for termites and did not arrange for a bond with your pest control company, you may want to contact them and see if you can still sign an agreement. If you are buying or selling a home with previous termite problem and don\u2019t know have never heard of a termite bond before, definitely educate yourself and make a termite bond part of your home buying or selling process. Just make sure the terms are agreeable to you and the needs of your house.\nIn answer to the question, \u201cWhat is a termite bond?\u201d you could say simply it is a contract that guarantees future treatment if termites return. Another way to see it is an added form of insurance that protects the value and condition of your house and other buildings. You will need to decide for yourself if the continuing, nominal cost of a termite bond is worth it; many people who live in areas where termites are a constant problem and go through having to pay for termite extermination once see the value in it.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T23:52:23Z", "url": "https://neverpest.com/what-is-a-termite-bond/", "byte_size": 5575, "char_size": 5549}

{"text": "Recently, Netflix announced that the popular TV show \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d will be returning to small screens for its second season. Since its debut at the end of March, \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d has captivated the hearts of young adults and suddenly become everyone\u2019s #1 binge-worthy show. Naturally, with this upbringing of popularity comes controversy. However, it\u2019s for a good reason.\nBased off of a book about a teenage girl who gives tape recordings to those who lead her to commit suicide, the writers of \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d sought to depict suicide in \u201cunflinching\u201d detail. While some na\u00efve teenagers might be convinced of its good intentions, the show has received negative feedback from many mental health experts as well as more discerning members of the public.\nThough the writers claim that they are trying to shed some light upon the severity of suicide, in reality they glorify it and paint an inaccurate portrait of mental health for impressionable teenagers across the world.\nAs expected of Hollywood entertainment, chemistry is created between the two protagonists Hannah Baker and Clay Jensen for the sake of establishing romance. Hannah Baker, the girl who commits suicide, and Clay Jensen, one of the people featured on her tapes, became romantically involved before Hannah killed herself.\nThus, viewers became more involved with the romantic aspect of the show rather than becoming more sensitive to the potent issues it attempts to address. And so the depiction of two lovers in high school really makes it seem as if suicide was a storyline taken out of a cheesy rom-com, when in reality, it is far more messy and should not be seen as entertainment.\nFurthermore, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention lists \u201cexposure to another person\u2019s suicide, or to graphic or sensationalized accounts of suicide,\u201d which the show takes pride in doing, as a risk factor for those with depression. Keeping this in mind, \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d has failed to address the plotline with the seriousness it deserves, allowing the public to derive humor out of a topic that should not be taken so lightly.\nDue to its widespread popularity, the public has reacted to the show with memes such as \u201cwelcome to your tape\u201d along with thousands of Tumblr pages bashing on supporting characters and \u201cshipping\u201d Hannah and Clay together. There are gifs, there are tweets and there are even promposals. Oh yes, there are \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d you should go to prom with me\u201d posters adorned with flowers and chocolate roses that completely disregard the seriousness of suicide. Instead of understanding from the show that suicide is a grave matter, many members of Generation Z now use quotes from it as cute ways to ask someone out or as punchlines to a good joke.\nDue to the portrayal of suicide on the show, viewers now see bullying as the sole reason behind suicide. We see Hannah cyber-bullied, taunted and sexually harassed by her classmates. While bullying may be an important factor behind suicide, the show does not give any attention to mental illness. Yet according to USA Today, 90 percent of people who commit suicide suffer from mental health problems. So, whether it be bipolar disorders or schizophrenia or substance abuse, \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d trivializes the concept of suicide to only bullying and sends a message to the world saying: Be kind; it\u2019ll save a life.\nHowever, Yorkey\u2019s words further prove that the creators of the show are failing to understand why it is receiving such heavy backlash. Was sensationalizing Hannah\u2019s suicide \u2014 and the implicit suggestion that she was only recognized and appreciated after her death \u2014 not a way of painting suicide as a desirable alternative? Was going forth with the graphic depictions of self harm not detrimental to effectively addressing the issue of suicide?\nUltimately, the damage Netflix\u2019s \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d inflicts may have been unintended, but it echoes in the minds of teenagers whose perspectives are greatly influenced by the media they\u2019re exposed to. Suicide is by all means a serious issue, and allowing it to be misconstrued as a glamorous and desirable alternative is distasteful.\nIf the creators truly wish to proceed with this hot mess of a show while disregarding the criticism it has received, \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d will only serve to prove that Hollywood would rather capitalize off of sensitive topics than seriously consider ways that they can use their influence to help society.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T20:31:36Z", "url": "https://tideline.news/2078/archive/how-13-reasons-why-glorifies-suicide/", "byte_size": 4500, "char_size": 4429}

However, as was my duty, I took writh me ten camels, laden with rich presents for the Sultan.\nWe had been travelling for about a month, when one day we saw a cloud of dust moving swiftly towards us; and as soon as it came near, we found that the dust concealed a band of fifty robbers. Our men barely numbered half, and as we were also hampered by the camels, there was no use in fighting, so we tried to over\u00adawe them by informing them who we were, and whither we were going. The robbers, however, only laughed, and declared that was none of their business, and, without more words, attacked us brutally. I defended myself to the last, wounded though I was, but at length, seeing that resistance was hopeless, and that the ambassador and all our followers were made prisoners, I put spurs to my horse and rode away as fast as I could, till the poor beast fell dead from a wound in his side. I managed to jump off without any injury, and looked about to see if I was pursued. But for the moment I was safe, for, as I imagined, the robbers were all engaged in quarrelling over their booty.\nI found myself in a country that was quite new to me, and dared not return to the main road lest I should as:ain fall into the hands of the robbers. Luckily my wound was only a slight one, and after binding it up as well as I could, I walked on for the rest of the day, till I reached a cave at the foot of a mountain, where I passed the night in peace, making my supper off some fruits I had gathered on the way.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T12:46:26Z", "url": "http://www.childrensnursery.org.uk/arabian-nights/arabian-nights%20-%200176.htm", "byte_size": 1661, "char_size": 1660}

I took a few photos, so here they are.\nI also visited (but did not photograph) The Anchor, Hillfarrance; The Victory, Allerford; The Lamb and Flag, Blagdon; The Queens Arms, Pittminster; and Brazz, Taunton. Of all of these pubs, the Lamb and Flag is the nicest and most \"local pub\" type, and the Queens Arms is full of comedy parody type characters.\nThe Parade, Taunton. This is now a roundabout around the war memorial (the stone cross thing) and outside The Market House (the big building. It's a pub, but a bit of a meat market - hence the name?) which is all cobbled and unfriendly to traffic. Unfortunately this is the centre of town, there is no bypass, and Taunton has nowhere else for traffic to go.\nCastle Bow - looking through the portcullis by the entrance to Brazz, through to the battlements on the top of The Winchester Arms. Yes, Taunton is old, pretty, and full of pubs. Nothing else though.\nWe went to a substation so I could photograph pylons. Here's one photo. Won't bore you with the rest - if you want them, see my pylons site.\nIt's held in an old theatre hall, which has been converted quite well and retains the original (very gaudy!) decor. Please note that not everyone in attendance is old.\nThe room is dotted with fruit machines, to fleece you for more cash. They also play \"line games\" on boards built into the tables, in between \"real\" games.\nThe numbers which were called are shown on this board, along with the type of game being played and the amount of money for winning. However I could only photograph the board when I wasn't busy playing so it's not lit! Also there is a (cheap) bar, and (horrid) food counter.\nHere are the books you play with. You have to listen for which book is in play, and then which page (the yellow page in the bronze book, etc.) Then you have to get the line, two lines or full house on the same ticket on that page. There are six tickets to a page, so every single number is on the page somewhere. If you win you shout out. According to the leaflet you can shout anything you like. It's probably as well I haven't won yet.\nWe also investigated a phenomenon where, when you stand under electricity lines holding a fluorescent tube, the electromagnetic current induces the tube to glow in your hand. We did this right by the substation, where you can hear the wires crackling 24/7 as it is.\nAnd here's the glowing tube. It was actually a lot more impressive, but my camera doesn't pick it up well in the dark. A real light sabre moment!\nI slept on a mattress on top of a desk in the garage.

Wacha is 4-7 with a 6.41 ERA in 16 games (14 starts) against the Cubs.\nThe Cubs will enter Sunday's primetime showdown having lost four straight games after putting together five straight victories. The Cubs finally showed promise offensively Saturday, when they snapped a nine-game string of games in which they scored three or fewer runs.\nBut after blowing two different leads as their slide continued, the Cubs will attempt to get back on track in Sunday's series finale.\nThe back and forth Cubs performance has been difficult to predict after they finished a 5-2 homestand despite struggling to score runs.\nManager Joe Maddon found silver linings in the Cubs' recent roller coaster ride and continues to point to how early in the season his team's Jekyll and Hyde act has surfaced.\n\"Regardless of what your plan may be, teams are going to go through these moments,\" Maddon told reporters before Saturday's game, according to the Chicago Tribune. \"It just happens to be ours right now. I want to continue to work like we've been working. I believe in our guys and believe in our methods. It's just the ebb and flow of the season. Right now, it's our turn.

These nicely make the point that drivers need to be ever-vigilent for danger - particularly where hazardous substances are present.\n+ The first example occured on August 19 at a petrol station in St. Augustine, Florida.

{"text": "There are a bunch of action cameras now available in the Indian market and the most popular of them is the Go Pro. However, the Go Pro budget action cam also has a rather high price to begin with. Enter Go Noise Play 2, which is not so exorbitantly priced and has some of the latest features like Wi-Fi and app support one wants from an action cam. We put the Go Noise Play 2 on our test bench and used it over the last couple of weeks to know more about it. This is our review of the pocket friendly action camera.\nOut of the box the Go Noise Play 2 looks very similar to the Go Pro, but has its own distinct features. The front is dominated by a large lens (16 MP) that also has the power button along with the branding at the bottom. The left side has the microSD card slot along with the micro HDMI and proprietary TV and charging port. The speaker grille is also placed on this side. Top has the shutter release button, while the bottom slots the replaceable 1,200 mAh rechargeable battery and tripod port.\nThe rear has the fairly bright 2-inch TFT touchscreen. There is an unusually large black band around the touchscreen, which could have been reduced and one could have got a larger display. There are a total of three LED\u2019s on the Go Noise Play 2. One over the screen, the other next to the shutter release button and the last one on the front of the camera. All three can be customised and turned on or off.\nSetting up the camera does not take much time. In the box you just get the camera and charging cable. Rest of the accessories are sold separately, so you might want to pick those too. These include a Go Pro like waterproof enclosure, mounting accessories etc one would need when going out in the wild. the Go Noise Play 2 supports memory cards of up to 128 GB and you would need to purchase that additionally as well, since this action camera has no on board memory.\nWe took it out for a spin and found it quite nice during day light. It can record videos at 4K 24 FPS and the results were sharp and close to life. It\u2019s in low light or at night that this action camera loses its touch. Noise and blurred edges are evident and not much can be done to help that. The Go Noise Play 2 is certainly not a picture taker. It struggles in that department.\nWe quite enjoyed the underwater video shooting with this camera. The videos were not bad at all and can put many others in the same price bracket to shame. There are lot of shooting modes available on the Go Noise Play 2 including our favourite time lapse. Slow motion mode is also there, which works fine but the to get better frame rates one needs to comprise on the resolution.\nUsers can also download the Noise Play 2 app from the Play store and manage the camera with it. Apple users you might want to skip this if you want app compatibility, since it is available only for Android users. The battery takes 1.5 hours to charge fully and gave us around 3 hours of video shooting time.\nOverall, the Go Noise Play 2 impressed us at some levels and at some we wanted more from it. If you want an inexpensive option to start with then this seems to be a fit. The performance is not bad and the wide lens does manage to capture most of what you are seeing.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T17:15:22Z", "url": "https://www.gadgetbridge.com/gadget-reviews/go-noise-play-2-review-good-to-start-with/2433/", "byte_size": 3226, "char_size": 3222}

{"text": "Taylor St. Jacques,18, of Glen Allen, Va., captured the win in the Dover Saddlery/USEF Hunter Seat Medal Final, at the at the Pennsylvania National Horse Show, presented by The Lindsay Maxwell Charitable Fund. The victory was emotional as this was her last year of eligibility as a junior and therefore the last chance to win the Medal Final.\nThe day began with an initial round of 257 riders. The top 25 were called back for the second round, which was narrowed down to an additional test for the top four. The final test required riders to complete a course of eight numbered obstacles (nine jumping efforts) without stirrups. In the second round and in the final test, the riders returned in reverse order of merit. St. Jacques was called back on top for both so she had to wait for all of the other riders to take the course, a daunting position.\n\"I was a little nervous coming back for the final test. I've come back on top a few times at some smaller shows and I think that really prepared me for this big class. I wasn't as nervous as I thought I would be,\" said St. Jacques. \"I was really excited when they said no stirrups. I think that's a strong suit of mine. I thought that was pretty cool and funny. My mom called it down at the [Winter Equestrian Festival], that at the final there was going to be a test with no stirrups and it happened!\"\nJudges Tammy Provost and Jack Towell had not planned to test the riders. However, the scores were so close, they felt it necessary to see them again.\n\"Taylor never made a mistake,\" said Provost. \"In the final test we were looking for who was strong without their stirrups and Taylor was really strong. We were thinking more Hunter Derby and Hunter Seat Equitation Finals, with a soft and light position.\"\nTowell further explained the reasoning for their choice of a straight forward course instead of one with tricky turns and distances.\n\"It's called hunter seat equitation finals and in our minds, one of these riders would win the hunter derby and become world champion hunter rider. That's what they are supposed to do. We wanted to keep the course nice, safe, comfortable, and let us judge it. Let us decide who we thought was the best rider. We judged it more than the course. We judged the pace, the position, all of it and keeping in mind a hunter seat rider.\"\nCooper Dean of Fayette, Ala., was called back second to last for the test and kept his placing to finish as the runner-up. Dean was at a loss for words.\n\"All this is just surreal. I can't get the words out. It's just great,\" said Dean. \"It's really nice to have a really nice horse and I can't thank Andre [Dignelli] enough. I've thanked him every day for the past seven or eight months since I've been with him, but words don't do it justice. I'm just really grateful that Andre took me under his wing.\"\nDignelli was also the trainer of St. Jacques, who claimed that having the two students was a dream. St. Jacques believed that his tutelage went far beyond the show ring.\n\"It's meant the absolute world to me,\" said St. Jacques. \"He took me under his wing and he's really done wonders for me. I have a good feel for a horse, but he's improved my knowledge as a horsewoman and set me up for success in the future and I think that goes far beyond words. He's not just teaching me riding, he's teaching me how to be successful in life. Not every trainer can do that. He's been a great mentor and beyond amazing as a trainer. I'm very grateful for everything that he's done for me.\"\nSam Walker of Ontario, Canada, placed third in his first equitation Final. Walker was seventh following the second round and moved up to third place for the final test.\n\"I first started showing in the States about three years ago. I saw all the other big equitation riders and I really thought that one day I wanted to do that and get to a National Final like this,\" said Walker. \"It's my horse's first time and it's also my first time doing the Final. I really thought for my very first experience this was amazing and I would like to thank everybody for help making it happen.\"\nJordyn Rose Freedman of Longmeadow, Mass., placed fourth, moving up from eighth in the second round.\n\"In the second round I came back in eighth, so I was not very nervous. I was just trying to do everything I could to climb up to the test. I was just so happy because my horse was really great and I couldn't ask any more of him,\" said Freedman. \"I was so surprised to make the test. It was definitely a surreal moment. I was really excited. My goal this year was to make the second round, so to make the test was really great for my last junior year. I couldn't be happier.\"\nCharisma, the mount for St. Jacques won the Doris H.

{"text": "Today I made a quick video tutorial on how to create a new eye with sparkle from an existing eyeball. Our model is Oscar the Mini Doxie. If you are a digital artist or an aspiring one please consider joining me in Dallas on April 11th and 12th for a Photoshop Digital Painting workshop. In this 2 day hands on class I teach my students to use the smudge tool and the paint brushes in Photoshop to draw and paint using the Wacom drawing tablet. The class is only $205 for 12 hours of instruction. You can sign up at the Creative Arts Center website. This course is great for both the hobbyist that wants to create a pet portrait of their own pet and it is really terrific for artists and photographers that want to learn to add digital painting to their arsenal. In one of my classes I had 3 women from out of state that wanted to do what I do professionally and I was very generous with additional business information in relation to pet portraiture business models and resources.\nlast year I taught a mosaic class with a concentration on color. That course had me studying fun color trivia facts. This year I want to continue to celebrate color in every possible way that I can. This month my assistant Brittany and I have started sharing color trivia over on our Art Paw Face Book Page. Today I will post just a couple of trivia image posts that I created for our news feed. Below that I will share some animal related color trivia \u2026 enjoy.\n\u2022 Bees can\u2019t see the color red, but they can see all other bright colors. Red flowers are usually pollinated by birds, butterflies, bats, and wind, rather than bees.\n\u2022 Did you know that Goldfish lose their color if kept in dim light. Similar to humans, they need sunlight to keep their pigment.\n\u2022 Mosquitoes are attracted to the color blue twice as much as to any other color.\n\u2022 Schizochromatic (what a mouthful!) is a term meaning that an animal does not have a color that it normally would have.\n\u2022 If a creature is xanthochromatic then it had more yellow in it than normal.\nI am Swamped again with Pet Portrait orders! I just proofed this adorable Puggie.\nToday I will try very hard to proof 3 clients. I usually spend a couple of hours of painting on each portrait before I provide my first proofing round. Before I even sit down to add in color and brush strokes I usually have spent at least 30 minutes optimizing the photograph and erasing the background. For a traditional oil painter 2 and half hours may seem super fast however you have to also factor in the possible additional time I could spend reproofing and tweaking one of the provided proofs and then the production time of printing and stretching the canvases. I would guess that an average project can take me anywhere between 5 and 8 hours total. I do like to work in a bit of a production style meaning that yes today I will get to do the fun creative work of playing with color on 3 pet projects. Monday I spent the entire morning optimizing several photos and organizing new orders. If I can proof 3 clients today and 3 clients tomorrow I will start to feel caught up on my painting work.\nIf you are a new pet portrait artist just starting out you may think that 6 projects in one week sounds pretty overwhelming. The reality is that if you plan to make a full time income on pet portraiture you will have to become very efficient with your time. Or, you can also go the high end route of charging thousands for your work and then you can indeed have the luxury of lingering for weeks on one project. Too often however people are impatient and even if you have the time to spend weeks and months on one single portrait, it is the rare client that really wants to wait that long.\nSo now, I take a 15 minute break in between projects to rest my eyes, recharge and maybe even do a load of laundry.\nIf you are interested in ordering a portrait check out my main site artpaw.com and order on-line today.\nIf you want to take a class check out my schedule, I have a workshop in April!\nToday I updated sweet happy Kota. My client asked for tame colors similar to her original photo, however after showing her around 15 tame options she indicated that she might want to see more color on Kota. I was more than happy to go back in and add more color, all of my clients get one set of free changes if they are needed. In this video today I talk about my proofing terms and you can see me working a little bit in Photoshop adding some additional color and brush strokes. I also discuss the difference in how traditional painters working in oils or acrylics usually provide proofing and the flexibility that Photoshop allows us.\nI am very excited to be launching my new pet portrait blog where I will be sharing tutorials and a behind the scenes glimpse into my world of full time pet portraiture. I will be posting tutorials, videos and works in progress. I am Rebecca Collins and I run the portraiture studio artpaw.com. The cutie pie on this post is Belle, and this work was created during my busy holiday season. Last year I create over 200 pet portraits and this year I want to keep those numbers strong while also branching off into teaching my skills to others.\nSometimes I do worry that in sharing my knowledge with other artists I am just training my competition to steal my business and yet at the end of the day I know that there is plenty of work to go around. It is my hope that other artists will take my tips and then put their own unique spin on pet portraiture, raising the bar for us all.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Pet Portrait Blog. All Rights Reserved.

According to United Against Iran, \u201ca not-for-profit, non-partisan, advocacy group that seeks to prevent Iran from fulfilling its ambition to obtain nuclear weapons,\u201d each of these companies had or has business with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Furthermore, according to OpenSecrets.org, a website dedicated to enlightening the public about how much money is spent on lobbying expenditures, Weber has lobbied on behalf of one or more of the above listed companies as recently as 2012.\nThis raises serious questions about Romney\u2019s judgment when it comes to selecting his most trusted advisers. How committed can Romney be to stopping Iran in its pursuit of nuclear weapons if one of his top foreign policy advisers actually lobbied for companies that did business with Iran? What was Weber lobbying for?\nStopping Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons is one of the most pressing national security challenges facing us today and President Obama\u2019s resolve is clear. As Obama continues to strengthen sanctions and keep all options on the table to stop Iran, Romney has a top \u201cspecial adviser\u201d who actually lobbied for companies that did business with Iran.\nThat is quite the opposite.\nWorse, this is endemic of a party-wide challenge that the GOP seems to be having with regard to doing the right thing on Iran\u2014whether to side with big business or strengthening Iran sanctions, as evidenced by the fifth party-line House GOP vote to side with former over the latter.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T20:58:50Z", "url": "http://d22all9zt2shnx.cloudfront.net/media/entry/romny071712.html", "byte_size": 1998, "char_size": 1976}
{"text": "When people ask me what my favorite horror film is, I guess they would expect me to say \u201cHalloween\u201d or \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d And while I do love those movies and they, along with \u201cPsycho\u201d for instance, would be in my top-five of the genre, I say that my favorite in the genre is definitely \u201cThe Haunting.\u201d And the trouble is, I always have to back up that title by labeling it \u201cthe Robert Wise haunted-house film from the 1960s\u201d because I know that they\u2019re thinking of the other \u201cThe Haunting\u201d (the 1999 Jan De Bont remake of the 1963 film with Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones). I\u2019ll have something to say about the remake later and why it definitely doesn\u2019t work in comparison to its predecessor, but I truly love the original film. In fact, I love it so much to admit that it\u2019s just my favorite scary film\u2014it\u2019s one of my all-time favorite movies.\n\u201cThe Haunting\u201d is a superb, gorgeously-shot, very well thought-out chiller that uses psychological tension and character development in the same concepts of mystery and atmosphere. It takes place in a haunted house\u2014Hill House, to be exact\u2014and it\u2019s about a group of characters who would like to investigate the supernatural occurrences of such a place but get much more than they expected. That premise sounds pretty simple, but Wise\u2019s direction, along with great cinematography as well as great acting, makes it far more than what it could have been. Even if you don\u2019t really find it very scary (it depends on whether or not you accept the \u201cless is more\u201d aspect\u2014I\u2019ll explain later in this review), it\u2019s still a gripping psychological thriller, Gothic story, and character study.\n\u201cThe Haunting\u201d begins with an opening narration over a shot of an ominous-looking mansion in the night, and right away, the narration sets up the premise in a most interesting way. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard a depiction of a haunted house, or rather just exploring a haunted house, has ever been put in a better way. \u201cAn evil old house, the kind some people call haunted, is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House has stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there\u2026walked alone.\u201d And when the intellectual voice of Richard Johnson puts it like that, I think I might follow him as well as those his character, Dr. John Markway, are brought into his experiment. And yes, his experiment is simply to investigate any sort of paranormal activity while spending several nights in Hill House. The house is full of history that connects to further evidence that it may be haunted, which fascinates him even more. He wants to know if everything he\u2019s heard and studied is as real as it may seem.\nBrought in on the project are Eleanor \u201cNell\u201d Lance (Julie Harris), clairvoyant Theodora \u201cTheo\u201d (Claire Bloom), and the house\u2019s cynical new heir, Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn). Eleanor, in particular, is our main focus of the film, as we hear her inner thoughts a good amount of time and has the most compelling character arc of the group. She\u2019s a meek, insecure, guilt-ridden woman who has spent most of her adult life caring for her sick mother until her death, leading to further severe guilt that she has to deal with everyday. She seeks to belong somewhere with somebody, which is why she does take a chance and leaves her sister\u2019s apartment (where she sleeps on the couch), and steals her sister\u2019s car to make her way to Hill House, where she is finally expected somewhere.\nHill House itself is a marvel to look at. It\u2019s a large, maze-like mansion that looks like a Gothic castle, with many secrets and unsettling decorations and such. Among the most notable unsettling locations in the house is the library, which features a tall, spiraling staircase that is very rickety and unsafe. The exteriors and interiors of Hill House are just extraordinary and the whole place gives off a creepy vibe. You definitely can tell that something is not quite right with this place. Eleanor notices this upon first arriving, thinking to herself that \u201cit\u2019s looking at me\u201d and if she goes into this house, she\u2019s afraid she won\u2019t come out the same way. But she does come inside, get to know Markway, Theo, and Luke, and surely enough, many strange things occur with apparent supernatural forces at work here.\nBut how much of the supernatural is actually \u201csupernatural?\u201d We spend so much time with Eleanor and we know that she isn\u2019t quite mentally-stable because of her insecurities that sometimes take her over, so you have to wonder just how much of this ghost-story is actual ghosts and how much of it is actually in Eleanor\u2019s mind. It\u2019s evident that ghosts are real in these surroundings, as Eleanor is not the only one to experience these happenings. But what about when she explores the house herself and feels herself to be more at home, in a way depicted creepier than it sounds? Is she being controlled by the paranormal forces, is she letting in to her hopes of belonging somewhere, are her insecurities getting the very best of her? I won\u2019t go into too much detail about what I get out of the connection between her and Hill House, but trust me when I say it\u2019s an excellent psychological study. And that this is a character who seeks redemption and acceptance within a haunted house makes it even more unnerving.\nIt\u2019s hard to pick my favorite \u201cscary moment,\u201d as most people choose their own favorite scary moments from their favorite horror films (the opening in \u201cHalloween,\u201d the exorcism in \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d the shower scene in \u201cPsycho,\u201d and so on). There are literally more than I could think of right off the bat, and oddly enough, every time I watch the movie again, I find myself unnerved throughout the whole movie because of those many moments. To name some of these scenes, I\u2019d start with the introduction in which we see in flashback (with help of Dr. Markway\u2019s narration) the past historic happenings of Hill House (suicide, accidents, etc.)\u2014it\u2019s a great opening and also very well-crafted in how it\u2019s able to set up the environment and build up suspense for the rest of the story, and of course quite unnerving. There\u2019s the first occurrence on the characters\u2019 first night in Hill House, as Eleanor and Theo are frightened by loud, pounding noises coming from outside their bedroom and hold onto one another in fear\u2014the terror is genuine and the scares come as unexpected so that the characters\u2019 fear becomes ours, because we know just about as much as they do. Most memorably, arguably, is the scene in which Eleanor awakens at night to hear what sounds like a child being beaten and crying in pain. She wants to yell but is too afraid to, and she holds hands with Theo who is obviously as frightened as she is because, as we hear through Eleanor\u2019s inner thoughts, she is holding on to her hand a little too tightly. When she finally yells \u201cSTOP IT!\u201d and the lights turn on, she looks to see that\u2026nobody was holding her hand the whole time. This is a perfect \u201cscary moment\u201d\u2014the buildup, the tension, and the payoff are all very well-handled, making the standard-but-needed question \u201cWhose hand was I holding\u201d seem all the more impactful. There are many more moments like that in this movie. And do I even need to mention that the aforementioned \u201ctall, spiraling staircase\u201d comes into place for a crucial moment later?\nThe casting of the four principal roles is spot-on. Julie Harris is excellent as Eleanor, creating a believable portrait of an odd, meek woman who is possibly misguided to find a place to feel accepted. It\u2019s a great performance and it makes \u201cThe Haunting\u201d more of a character study than a haunted-house story. Richard Johnson is also great as Dr. Markway, a man who could convince you to jump off a cliff if he found a solid reasoning behind it. I love the way he puts the supernatural occurrences most of us have heard of, particularly the difference between \u201cghosts\u201d and \u201cghouls.\u201d Claire Bloom makes Theo her own character and also gives a certain indication that she might actually be a lesbian, which could explain why she acts the way she does toward Eleanor (compassion mixed with teasing most of the time) and also would give another disturbing sense in the scenes when they\u2019re the only ones in a room together. Bloom makes risky decisions with this role, but they\u2019re never over-the-top and are played effectively. I even enjoyed Russ Tamblyn\u2019s comic relief\u2014as Luke, Tamblyn plays a man who doesn\u2019t believe in the supernatural or the phenomena; he\u2019s just protecting his investment after being left the house and simply enjoys poking fun at whatever experience or little detail that the other characters bring up. He\u2019s a smooth, wisecracking guy who likes to drink and crack jokes (\u201cThis ghost I can expect in my room tonight\u2014is it male or female?\u201d), which makes his ultimate belief in what\u2019s really happening here all the more effective because all this time, he has served as a representation for some of the more cynical audience members. When he finally seems as scared as everyone else, it\u2019s believable.\nThe filmmaking serves as another reason \u201cThe Haunting\u201d works as well as it does. A good number of shots in this movie looks like it\u2019s been fully prepared for first, so that we feel a hint of unease and also fascination. Even the reaction shots, which are mostly thankless, say something about the consistency\u2014some of them are even at low angles with characters on either the right or left side of the screen. With a location as grand as Hill House, it\u2019s important to know how to frame certain shots and Robert Wise obviously went out of his way to create something unique.\n\u201cThe Haunting\u201d is undoubtedly my favorite horror film. Its scares are more than effective because of how much its psychological terror works well. The themes are very well-presented. The depictions of the \u201chaunted\u201d aspects of this house and the occurrences are fascinating to listen to. The lead character of Eleanor is a great character for this sort of story. And it fascinates me and of course continues to scare me every time I watch it. It\u2019s a well-crafted, excellent chiller.\nNOTE: I mentioned the brilliant opening lines earlier in this review. I should also add that the similar-sounding ending lines are even more chilling, particularly because of who says them.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T10:34:17Z", "url": "https://smithsverdict.com/2013/07/29/the-haunting-1963/", "byte_size": 10551, "char_size": 10317}

{"text": "I\u2019ve been told that I have my mother\u2019s eyes and my father\u2019s smile. Sometimes the genetics we inherit reveal themselves in very obvious ways. And sometimes they don\u2019t. Recently I wrote this post about DNA tests that can identify your skin\u2019s inherent strengths and weaknesses, enabling you to pinpoint exactly what skincare products are best for you based on your unique genetic profile. This is a critical breakthrough because without this type of information, it\u2019s impossible to know the specific needs of your skin. This is why we buy from the brands that we like (or that have a great sales pitch), get lucky with a few products and end up with a drawer full of skin care rejects that didn\u2019t deliver as promised because they weren\u2019t the right match for our skin. The beauty of these DNA tests is that they take out the guesswork, providing you with clear guidelines on how to shop for your skincare, supplements and professional skin treatments.\nOf course I could hardly wait to take the test and reveal my skin\u2019s genetic destiny, but I also truly wondered if the information would be valuable to me or not. As someone extremely well versed in skincare, I already knew how to cut through the category clutter and felt very confident in my skincare regimen.\nGlycation Protection (Gene 3)\u2013 Quick skincare lesson: glycation occurs when excess bodily glucose (sugar) molecules link to the skin\u2019s collagen and elastin fibers. Glycated fibers then become rigid and have reduced regenerative ability, leading to accelerated skin aging in the form of wrinkling and decreased elasticity. On a scale of 1-10, my skin\u2019s ability to protect against glycation is about a 2.5. Major fail. So what do I do?\nWell, this is where it gets interesting. New evidence in the study of epigenetics proves how the lifestyle choices we make can either speed up or slow down the aging process. This can take the form of deciding whether or not to wear sunscreen, or in my case, whether or not to lay off the sugar and carbs. So with this hard data in hand, I can either blame my inevitable premature aging on bad genes, or I can start eating a low sugar diet and basically eliminate the expression of this genetic deficiency. The test has given me the power to alter how my skin ages \u2013 whether I like what I need to do or not. Kind of mind blowing, right?\nNow for some, this info wouldn\u2019t be that enlightening. But it is for me \u2013 my husband is an owner in a gelato company and a partner in a bakery. I love sweets and eat more than I should, making this information highly valuable and certainly worth the $299 price of the test.\nBut enough about me. What do tests like this mean for the future of the skincare industry? Here\u2019s what I think. Right now, SkinDNA has the genetic data on over 40,000 people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. They are adding to this at a rate of 15,000+ individuals a year and running all kinds of correlation studies. These studies generate statistics that have the ability to alter the way skincare is formulated and marketed. For example, they can identify genetic patterns among certain groups that can predict an increased likelihood of a genetic tendency. So I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before this data is sold to a L\u2019Oreal or Estee Lauder who can use it to either create new brands or reposition existing ones using this hard data as a guide. Then for those like me who want an individualized DNA report, the door is opened for companies to create bespoke skincare including both topicals and injestibles. GENEU, who offers a test similar to what I took through SkinDNA, is currently offering a personalized anti-aging serum based on your DNA results. Product starts at \u00a3300 for a 4 week supply.\nThe really crazy thing is that DNA testing is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the future of customized skincare. New developments in biology will soon enable custom-made professional treatments, like using an individual\u2019s own blood platelets to create protein-rich, collagen stimulating injectables. By using one\u2019s own skin tissue as the basis for a filler, it has the potential to last longer and be more effective. Then there\u2019s this: Biomedical Micro-engineering researchers at Heriot Watt University in Scotland, in collaboration with stem cell technology company Roslin Cellab, have created a breakthrough printing process that enables 3-D printing of embryonic cell cultures. These embryonic stem cells have an ability to replicate indefinitely and differentiate into almost any cell type in the human body (and I thought 3-D printed packaging was cool!). Since stem cells have the ability to regenerate damaged cells, this technology is expected to basically revolutionize the beauty industry and may truly become the future fountain of youth, all within the next two decades.\nOf course I\u2019m all over this, so you can be sure that I\u2019ll keep you posted as more and more research emerges. It\u2019s going to be a wild ride!", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T11:13:54Z", "url": "http://brandettes.com/adventures/genetics-and-the-future-of-skincare/", "byte_size": 5001, "char_size": 4952}

{"text": "A startling novel powerfully displaying dynamics of sin and redemption, working across time. Something odd is happening to John Faversham, a scientifically minded Englishman of the late 20th century. By chance, he acquires a volume of poems by a minor 19th century poet, who turns out to have lived in his house. Moreover, one of the poems records a vivid dream which has recently been troubling John. How does be come to share a disturbing dream with a long-dead previous owner of his house? As Anthony Duncan's novel unfolds, we discover the roots of the story in the events of the English Reformation, in the 16th century. This sometimes startling tale powerfully displays dynamics of sin and redemption, working across time. But the author avoids any easy moralism. The novel is all the more powerful in its compelling depiction of life's knotted fabric, in which good and evil cannot be easily untangled.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T12:53:54Z", "url": "https://www.thoth.co.uk/books/favershams-dream", "byte_size": 909, "char_size": 909}

{"text": "Everyone knows that when it comes to the New York Rangers, Henrik Lundqvist owns the crease.\nSince joining the league in 2005, the \u201cKing\u201d has broken every Rangers\u2019 goaltending record, has set NHL records of his own, and has meant the world to this franchise. In fact, it\u2019s hard to imagine where the Blueshirts would be without him.\nWith all of that said, however, Lundqvist is certainly on the back nine of his career. He just turned 36 back on March 2, his numbers are not where they used to be, and the team in front of him is getting younger, which could mean a lot of tough and long nights ahead for him.\nWhile Lundqvist is still a good goaltender and one who was an All-Star this past season, it is time for the organization to start thinking about the future when it comes to who will be the heir to Lundqvist\u2018s throne. It will certainly be a sad day when Lundqvist is no longer between the pipes, but it is a reality that the franchise and their fans will have to face.\nThe team kind of started going in the right direction in terms of their future in goal when they brought up Alexandar Georgiev from the American Hockey League\u2019s (AHL) Hartford Wolf Pack. Georgiev, 22, who is more than likely slated to be the team\u2019s back-up this season, impressed the Rangers\u2019 brass and their fans last year by playing well in 10 games and showing that he could be a more than a solid NHL masked man.\nWhile his record (4-4-1) and bloated goals-against average (3.15) don\u2019t exactly scream future Rangers\u2019 goaltender, his performance between the pipes suggests otherwise. He made a lot of timely saves, kept his team in games they had no business being in,and showed that come crunch time in a tight game, he can get the job done and help his team win hockey games.\nGeorgiev also finished his short stint with a .915 save percentage. That\u2019s pretty impressive considering just how bad the team\u2019s defense was after the trade deadline.\nWith that said, Georgiev is not the true future for this team in net. That title belongs to Igor Shestyorkin.\nShestyorkin, 22, has been an absolute stud in the KHL for SKA St. Petersburg. He went 20-4-4 last season with a sparkling 1.69 goals against average, a .933 save percentage and seven shutouts.\nIf you can believe it, he was even better the year before as he was 27-4-6 with a 1.64 goals against average, a .937 save percentage, and eight shutouts. This shows that he is consistent and at the NHL level, that is obviously a big thing.\nNo one is quite sure when Shestyorkin will be coming to Broadway. According to Larry Brooks of the New York Post, a source told him that Shestyorkin will have to play out his contract in the KHL, which ends after next season, before coming to New York.\nAnother solid goaltending prospect that the Blueshirts have is Brandon Halverson. Halverson, 22, did not post the greatest numbers in five games with the Wolf Pack, Halverson has a lot of potential as he has great lateral movement, and knows how to control his rebounds.\nIt\u2019s not like the Rangers need to make a decision right now regarding who will take over for the King when all is said and done. It is never too early, however, to start thinking about who the future will be between the pipes for this franchise.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T12:45:30Z", "url": "https://wtpsports.com/2018/09/01/time-for-the-blueshirts-to-look-towards-future-in-net/", "byte_size": 3262, "char_size": 3236}

{"text": "Mississippi State won the Southeastern Conference regular-season title one year after finishing in the league basement.\nNow the Bulldogs want to carry the momentum of that dramatic rise into the postseason.\nMississippi State (40-14-1, 21-9 SEC) enters this week's Southeastern Conference Tournament as the No. 1 seed after winning its first regular-season league title since 1989. The Bulldogs had gone 24-30 overall and 8-22 in conference play in 2015 to finish last in the Western Division and post the SEC's worst overall league record.\nBulldogs coach John Cohen, who played for Mississippi State's last SEC regular-season champions, said there isn't much of a gap separating the top of the conference from the bottom.\n\"If you're an inch off in the Southeastern Conference, you're going to get punched in the mouth a lot,\" Cohen said.\nSEC Tournament play begins Tuesday in Hoover, Alabama. No. 6 seed Vanderbilt (41-15, 18-12) faces No. 11 seed Missouri (26-29, 9-21), No. 7 seed Mississippi (40-16, 18-12) meets No. 10 seed Georgia (27-29, 11-19), No. 8 seed Kentucky (32-24, 15-15) battles No. 9 seed Alabama (31-24, 15-15) and No. 5 seed LSU (39-17, 19-11) tackles No. 12 seed Tennessee (29-27, 9-21) in single-elimination games.\nTuesday's winners advance to double-elimination play beginning Wednesday along with Mississippi State, No. 2 seed South Carolina (42-13, 20-9), No. 3 seed Texas A&M (41-13, 20-10) and No. 4 seed Florida (44-11, 19-10). The tournament returns to a single-elimination format Saturday and has a championship game Sunday.\nMississippi State made its dramatic rise up the standings by getting improvement from its new players and receiving a huge impact from its newcomers. Mississippi State's three top batting averages are owned by freshman Jake Mangum (.427) and junior-college transfers Nathaniel Lowe (.359) and Jack Kruger (.358). Kruger has a team-high .570 slugging percentage, Mangum leads the Bulldogs in on-base percentage (.479) and Lowe has a team-leading 47 RBIs.\n\"Those are all three new guys who have just had great first years,\" Cohen said. \"That's not common in the Southeastern Conference.\"\nCohen also led Kentucky to a regular-season title in 2006 and is the second coach to win an SEC regular-season championship at two different schools. Ron Polk led Mississippi State to four SEC regular-season championships before winning one at Georgia in 2001.\nHere are some things to watch in the SEC tournament.\nFIGHTING FOR POSITION: The top SEC teams already are assured of NCAA Tournament invitations but are trying to improve their positioning. Florida, Texas A&M, Mississippi State, South Carolina, Ole Miss, LSU and Vanderbilt all would like to be considered as regional hosts and/or national seeds.\nBUBBLE BATTLE: Alabama coach Mitch Gaspard and Kentucky's Gary Henderson acknowledge their teams are on the NCAA Tournament bubble after going .500 in conference play during the regular season. The two teams face each other Tuesday. \"You've got to win this game, you've got to get to the double-elimination part, you've probably got to beat (Mississippi State) on Wednesday and build those RPI points,\" Henderson said. Gaspard said that \"the winner of that game is going to have a whole lot more comfort after it and the loser is going to be sitting home on pins and needles for a week.\"\nDOMINANT GATORS/TIGERS: LSU has won five of the last eight SEC tournaments. Florida won last year's SEC Tournament and also earned the title in 2011.\nWHO'S SURGING: Mississippi State is on an 11-game winning streak. LSU had won 11 in a row \u2014 including two straight victories over Florida \u2014 before losing its regular-season finale to the Gators.\nWHO'S MISSING: Auburn (23-33, 8-22) and Arkansas (26-29, 7-23) had the SEC's two worst conference records and consequently didn't make the 12-team tournament field. With its losing record, Arkansas also is expected to miss the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2001.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T18:36:13Z", "url": "http://www.tlgnewspaper.com/mississippi-state-makes-dramatic-rise-to-earn-secs-top-seed", "byte_size": 3958, "char_size": 3954}

{"text": "I was brimming with excitement all of Thursday. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about my date with Seabiscuit. I was very excited about his joining me at the theater plus the night adventures that would follow.\nI hurried home after work, took a quick shower, and headed out. It had been a warm day, and I was doubtful that I needed my jacket; however, then I remembered being cold at a previous performance in the evening. Even though I had checked the weather and saw Orinda was only predicted to be in the low 60s in the evening, I knew that up in the hills, where the theater is actually located, it can get much colder. I felt foolish carrying such a large jacket on BART and felt too warm to need it, but better safe than sorry.\nIt was good I did. By the time I arrived at the theater, it was significantly cooler. I was happy without a jacket but realized that once the sun finished setting, I would need to put it on. I waited for Seabiscuit to arrive, and was excited to see him clean-shaven\u2013as I had ordered as his Mistress. How good that he should obey so well! And he finally looked like one of his own photographs.\nI told him previously that he appeared to be a servant of the Many-Faced God because his face never seemed to match from one photograph to another. The angles were off or something seemed so strange about it. He didn\u2019t look like his photographs. I knew it was him, but how strange and different they all seemed.\nThere was a crowd, and I could tell he felt a bit shy. We hugged and kissed each other\u2019s cheeks, then held hands as we walked up the hill from Will Call to the theater.\nHe bought dinner for us at the caf\u00e9, and we continued holding hands. The line was long, and we really only had 10 minutes to eat before needing to be seated. He was impressed by my tickets and how close we were to the stage. The temperature had dropped significantly, so I put on my jacket when we were seated but he was astounded that I didn\u2019t close it until after intermission. I held his hand in his lap during the first half.\nDuring intermission, he rented a blanket while I used the restroom and got my free bag of Peet\u2019s coffee for renewing my subscription for the theater. We shared the blanket, and for the second half, he held my hand on my lap.\nThe performance was amazing, as all the shows I have seen there have been. CalShakes has done very well at selecting and directing plays that resonate with race issues going on currently, and this play was exceptionally well done in that regard. Seabiscuit enjoyed it greatly, and I told him he should return with me for all of next season. He said he would love to. It was his first time going to the theater in a very long time, and he said the final scenes with the bed on stage would linger in his memory for a long time.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T02:13:59Z", "url": "https://felicitasfortuna.com/2016/10/08/othello/", "byte_size": 2794, "char_size": 2781}

{"text": "Michael McFadyen's Scuba Diving - Darts Point On the north-western side of Longnose Point there is a nice beach that is protected from all but southerly winds. I am not sure of the name of this beach. When I spent a weekend on the liveaboard Ocean Trek, we had lunch on the Sunday off this beach. Before lunch, we went for a dive on the point to the west of the beach. This is Darts Point.\nThe dive started by climbing aboard Ocean Trek's tender, Priscilla, and being taken around the point to a spot west of the beach. Here we entered the water and did a \"drift\" dive back to the mother vessel. The reef in closer to the shore is about 10 metres and there is a small wall dropping to about 12 metres. Darts Point itself continues under the water in a series of small ridges, running roughly north/south. Following the reef from where you enter the water to the south sees the reef get deeper to about 20 metres. The reef all along here consists of a sandy bottom with small boulders. The boulders have sponges, sea squirts and small gorgonias growing on them. There are the usual fishlife here, including some small rays, giant cuttlefish and various species of leatherjackets.\nOnce you hit the 20 metres, turn to the south-east and you will ascend to about 13 metres. It is now time to cross over the ridges. These are only a metre or so high and there are two or three of them. You are now heading to the north or north-east and eventually you will be on the sand again. Follow the sand edge (about 8 metres deep) to the north or north-east until near the boat and then cross the sand to do your safety stop under the boat.\nAnother very good dive, very easy but still interesting.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T15:50:18Z", "url": "http://michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=126", "byte_size": 1683, "char_size": 1683}

{"text": "The recent death of children that happened in Bihar due to improper management of the mid day meal scheme opens up another Pandora\u2019s box of the problems related to one of the largest government schemes in India. One such issue is the use of modern technologies, such as food fortification and ready-to-use therapeutic foods, as a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d solution to solve the problems of malnutrition in India. However, this food technology-dependent, single-solution approach fails to understand the complex and multiple linkages of the problem of malnutrition as it occurs in the rural areas and urban slums of the country.\nIt is obvious to everyone that the major determinants of childhood malnutrition include inadequate food availability, high rate of infections and lack of awareness. In the global context, it has been established that half of malnutrition load is due to those infections caused due to poor water supply and sanitation. The case of India cannot be any different as water supply systems are poor and inadequate in the country and diarrhoea is still one of the leading causes of child mortality.\nIn India the problem of malnutrition is predominantly viewed as the responsibility of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme, which has been responsible for supplementary feeding and growth monitoring of children. The current ICDS programme, which is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, has neither the mandate nor the machinery to address the prevention of infection among children or to treat them during illness, which is in fact contributing significantly to the problem of malnutrition. This was obvious when it was found that a quarter of those children who were treated for malnutrition at a Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs), a new institutional setting under the health department which combines feeding, treatment and awareness creation to severely malnourished children to prevent malnutrition deaths, were readmitted to the same centres within a duration of one year.\nHere, two aspects are important; first, initiatives like NRCs are only a crisis management initiative which can only prevent deaths due to malnutrition and not the problem of malnutrition per se. Drawing from this is the second aspect, which is that any intervention to address the problem of malnutrition should have potential to prevent occurrence of illness among children, which calls for ensuring safe water supply and sanitation, a widely ignorant sector in rural areas and urban slums.\nClosely related to it is the access to health services system so that disease and infections do not interfere with the growth of the child. In one of the tribal blocks of Madhya Pradesh, it was found that there were around five to seven episodes of illness with durations of 12-16 days reported in a year among those children who are poorly nourished. This means that several children remain ill for almost 70 to 80 days in a year, a duration that restricts normal growth further, making them more susceptible to malnutrition-infection cycle. The solution to address the problem of malnutrition hence calls for not only better feeding programme, but ensuring safe drinking water and sanitation together with access to health care for treating minor illnesses.\nIn short, the problem of malnutrition has to be understood in its broader dimension as it is just the tip of the iceberg of the underlying social development of a nation that fails to ensure basic employment, safe water supply and sanitation and primary health care. Any attempt to project the problem of malnutrition as a techno-managerial inadequacy not only will divert the focus leading to the adoption of unsuccessful strategies but also hamper the opportunity to correct the basic services that are faulty at the grassroots level. A proper public health approach to malnutrition calls for ensuring food security, prevention of illness and better treatment facility along with the need to provide opportunities for safe livelihood.\nDr. Mathew George is an Assistant Professor at the Centre for Public Health at the School of Health Systems Studies at the Tata Institute for Social Sciences in Mumbai, India.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T08:15:25Z", "url": "https://www.hunger-undernutrition.org/blog/2013/08/malnutrition-is-a-multifaceted-problem-in-need-of-a-multifaceted-solution.html", "byte_size": 4201, "char_size": 4195}
{"text": "Jessyka Allen had a good life, until it wasn't anymore. Finding herself in an impossible situation, with no noticeable way out, her job was an escape. Working at the small bar and grill put her in contact with some wonderful people, who Jess figured couldn't ever understand what she was going through.\nSo different but so good!!\nOh how I loved this story. This one stand-alone is a perfect blend of friends to lovers and military romance. Kason \u201cBenny\u201d Sawyer knew there was something going on with Jessyka. Jess has been their waitress at Aces for years so he could tell something wasn\u2019t right. When he goes to check on her one night he learns more than he bargains for. Jessyka was in a bad place feeling trapped in a situation. She needed a friend and Kason became that friend.\nAs things develop between them, feelings develop and they become more than friends. He becomes her anchor as she becomes his everything. This book has the usual action and suspense that Susan Stoker is known for but it also has a bit of twist.\nWhat made the experience of listening to Protecting Jessyka the most enjoyable?\nI love this series but I'm glad I waited to finish the series till I could get the last few books on audio. I know this may seem weird to some but I started this series by listening to it on audio and really wanted to finish it that way so I had to wait a bit to finish. Susan did not disappoint me at all and this has become one of my favorites of her's that I've read. With every book I've become more and more in love with this family/team she has created for this series. They may have started as a team but along the way they have become a family. I love how Jessyka had to protect Bennie and although she didn't like what she had to do she did it anyways to save her man.\nThe narrator Susan uses for this series does an outstanding job and when I'm listening to the man's voice in the story I never think that is a women talking like a man I just think how much I'm enjoying this book.\nI read this book when it was first released and loved it. The audio gave me a chance to dive back into a familiar favorite. Bloom is a wonderful narrator so she made this a delightful reread for me!\nOne Massive Defect destroyed the story!\nI have enjoyed the series even though it is over the top, filled with high school mentality overly possessive alpha-male heroes, tough but battered females who fall in perfect love (with multiple orgasims every hour) and bad guys that are the lowest of the low!\nThe storylines are a bit far-fetched but keeps you rooting for the main characters. Certain portions with make you laugh, shout out, tear up or get a bit excited! All the major characters in this series are great and learn to work together, gain trust, risk it all and become family!\nWhy two stars for what is a 4.5 star series? Without giving away anything, a Seal will never ignore his training or rush into a situation without obtaining Intel first... especially when members of his team are at the given location! I almost stopped listening at that point but decided to finish!\nSusan, please find a different way for the bad guys to gain control other than the soldiers blatantly ignoring the most basic part of their training. You obviously have an amazing amount of love and respect for the military which is one of the reasons that I love your novels. As a former Marine, it means a lot to me!\nIf you like military hero romance novels, Susan is a great author to read. 30 seconds of this book knocked it from 5 stars to 2 stars!\nI really like these stories but can't stand the whiny narrator!! I have tried & tried to listen to them but can't because is the female narrator!\nWould you listen to Protecting Jessyka again? Why?\nI would. This story had a tiny bit of a different spin with the others. It also showed the good guys didn't always follow the good guy rules with civilians. Also, it wasn't instant attraction. The team had been around Jessyka for a long time and it when it became clear she needed help did one step up to help her.\nShe is a very good narrator and her voice inflection really helps the feeling of the story.\nI enjoyed this book like all the others and it was nice to see one of the team's women had a physical disability that didn't help her appearance but would have made any other man think twice. Disabilities on women aren't usually front and center - she was a real character, not a runway model.\nLoving this series. Totally worth the credit. Lots of action and great romance. Stoker's leads are smart, sassy women and hot sweet alpha males.\nSeals are always hot, but there's nothing like a hard as nails, take charge woman. Jessyka, despite physical disabilities was smart and used those sharp wits to save herself and her man from a psycho. Don't miss her story.\nAnother great Stoker SEAL of Protection book. I highly recommend listening to the books in order.\nYou'll have to read/ listen to Protecting the Future to finally learn the source of Benny's nickname.\nI love the story, the characters, but too much bedroom for me. ( yes it said it before I got it) I fast forward past that part. But I also cried because the book was that good. I would love to see more books like this, and love the story line.\nGreat book Susan. I loved the people in this book. I love \ud83d\udc98 reading \ud83d\udcda books about seal men. I need some Protection in my life. I can't wait to read more books by Susan in the near future. Other great book to listen to on audio , and read.\nEvery book in this series is captivating and have unexpected twists. Well written and well read as well. thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters are so likeable and also a different twist to this book from the others in this series.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T15:10:41Z", "url": "https://www.audible.com/pd/Protecting-Jessyka-Audiobook/B017DXLX20?qid=&sr=", "byte_size": 5733, "char_size": 5721}
{"text": "When I joined JD Williams in January 2013 one of my first major tasks was to redesign the Fashion World e-commerce website for the Autumn / Winter 2013 season.\nIn the Fashion World brand pack it describes how Fashion World is a down-to-earth, straight talking, no nonsense brand. I wanted to reflect this within the design philosophy for the new website. I did this by going for a flat design approach, which meant stripping out any skeuomorphic elements such as drop shadows, gradients, bevels and rounded corners etc. Everything had to be strong, straight and simple with flat colours.\nFashion World had updated it\u2019s brand with the introduction of \u201cThe Clever Clothes Shop\u201d identity, and we had to include many new elements and marketing messages provided in a new graphics pack created by Red C Marketing Agency. There was a new colour scheme to put in place; pink = fashion, blue = services, red = sale and yellow & black = amazing value. For the first time in the website\u2019s history we introduced web fonts, the font chosen for headers was DIN Condensed Bold and for the body copy we kept it simple and stuck with Arial.\nThere were a few changes I wanted to make but a lot of research and experimenting was needed due to the fact that the Fashion World website shares a template with all the other JD Williams\u2019 brand websites (Jacamo, Simply Be, Marisota etc.) so I had to be careful that any changes I made didn\u2019t effect the other websites.\nI wanted to add social icons to the header to make them more prominent and really push social media for the brand, but in order to this I had to make some room. I did so by simplifying the search box. The old website had an input field, a category drop down menu and then the search button (in that order from left to right). After doing some research I discovered that less than 10% of visitors used the drop down menu and that the third most popular search term was nothing (blank) which meant people were just pressing the search button hoping for something to happen without entering a keyword or phrase. So I removed the drop down menu and united the input field and search button making it clear that it\u2019s one, simple search tool. This made some extra room for the social icons and I made them stand out by adding some CSS3 transitions.\nSome of my favourite pages include the Delivery & Returns page, I know it sounds boring and previously it was boring, it was just a page full of text with a grey background. Using a bit of jQuery I broke the information up into two clear sections making it easier to digest and added a lifestyle shot to add a bit of character. I also liked the following Free Format pages; The Leggings Directory, Coloured Jeans and New In. In the past designers had free range with the free format pages so they had the tendency to be a bit random. I wanted bring in a bit of consistency by making the headers of the free formats all the same size, font and style with social share buttons always in the top right and any navigational buttons and call to actions near the top of the page. Then whatever happens below in the main content area is up to the designer.\nTake a look at the new Fashion World website and let me know what you think, leave a comment below or get in touch.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T12:00:59Z", "url": "http://www.wayneseddon.co.uk/portfolio/fashion-world-aw13/", "byte_size": 3268, "char_size": 3254}
{"text": "Researchers from the University of Southern California have discovered that a drug currently being developed to treat stroke patients could also prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The study, which will be published January 15 in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, shows that the genetically engineered protein 3K3A-APC protects the brains of mice with Alzheimer\u2019s-like symptoms, reducing the buildup of toxic peptides and preventing memory loss.\n\u201cBecause of its neuroprotective, vasculoprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities in multiple models of neurological disorders, we investigated whether 3K3A-APC can also protect the brain from the toxic effects of amyloid-beta toxin in a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d says Berislav V. Zlokovic, Director of the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California.\nToxic amyloid-beta peptides accumulate in the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients, leading to neurodegeneration and reduced blood flow within the brain. Zlokovic and colleagues found that 3K3A-APC significantly reduced the accumulation of amyloid-beta in the brains of mice that usually produce large amounts of the toxic peptide. 3K3A-APC treatment prevented these mice from losing their memory and helped maintain normal cerebral blood flow. The drug also suppressed inflammation within the brain, another common feature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nZlokovic and colleagues found that 3K3A-APC protects the brain by preventing nerve cells from producing an enzyme called BACE1 that is required to produce amyloid-beta. Several different inhibitors of BACE1 have been tested in clinical trials for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but the new study suggests that using 3K3A-APC to block the production of BACE1 could be an alternative approach, particularly at early stages of the disease when amyloid-beta has yet to accumulate to levels capable of permanently damaging the brain.\n\u201cOur present data support the idea that 3K3A-APC holds potential as an effective anti-amyloid-beta therapy for early stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease in humans,\u201d Zlokovic says.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T20:17:39Z", "url": "http://www.tunisiesoir.com/health/study-stroke-drug-may-also-prevent-alzheimers-disease-details-11965-2019/", "byte_size": 2113, "char_size": 2091}

He died on July 10.\nVibrio vulnificus is sometimes referred to as a \"flesh-eating bacteria\" but health officials say that label is misleading because it can not attack healthy skin.\nVibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacteria that resides in warm, brackish seawater. A department spokesman tells us the man also had underlying medical conditions.\nWhile neither the man's identity nor the name of the Sarasota restaurant has been released, the incident occurred earlier this month.\nIt reported $30.1bn in revenue for its fourth quarter, beating already high consumer estimates of $29.17bn. The company cited record levels of job postings and LinkedIn sessions, 41% gain over a year prior.\nBut archaeologists went ahead and did it, finding three decomposed mummies inside a mysterious black granite sarcophagus . Experts were driven from the site of an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus after opening it unleashed a putrid stench.\nGenome editing involves deliberately altering the DNA of a human embryo , sperm or egg before it is transferred to the womb. Before we get to that point, we must conduct further research to establish safety standards, according to the report.\nThere is an investigation protcol in place that notifies the restaurant and determines the batch where the oyster came from so that sale of that specific batch can be stopped.\nSymptoms can include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, wound infections and intestinal infections.\nThe CDC says that Vibrio vulnificus causes 80,000 illnesses each year in the United States. If the infection is contracted through the skin, it can lead to skin breakdown and ulcers. In 2016, Manatee County had two cases, while Sarasota County had three cases and one fatality.\nWhile Vibrio vulnificus is sometimes known as 'flesh-eating bacteria, ' the label is misleading because humans with healthy skin are not at risk.

Float property is used to flow an element to the left or right corner of parent container and the next element wrap around it. A floating element doesn't occupy space on normal flow. Thus we have to use clear both after last floating element to avoid wrapping.\nBy default, all html elements are non floating.\nChoose a option from radio buttons to check float property.\nThis is the text which can wrap around the image above if floated left or right. To now how float left, right and none works, please check a radio control below. This example will help you understand how CSS float left and right works. Float left will float image to left of parent and float right will flow image to right of parent element. After float, next element , i.e. paragraph will wrap around image.\nCSS Float Left push an element to the left corner of parent element, and other elements wrap around it. A floating element doesn't occupy space in flow. Thus next non floating element will wrap around floating element.\nIn this example, <img> tag is left floating and paragraph after image tag is non floating. So the parapragn is wrapping around img. The content inside paragraph is showing next to image, but paragraph is wrapping around image.\nDiv is the common element used to build layout. Div is block level and non floating. That means, the next div will always starts in new row.\nIf width of div is auto, div will occupy full width, but if width of div is in px or %, still new div starts from new row as div is block level.\nFloat Left is used on both division here. First aside is floated left, and then section div is also floated left. After both floating elements, a blank div clear is used to stop next element wraping around floating divs.\nFloat Right pull an element to the top Right corner of parent element, and other elements wrap around it.\nIn this example, img tag is right floating and paragraph after image tag is non floating. So the parapragn is wrapping around img. The content inside paragraph is showing next to image, but paragraph is wrapping around image. Check the yellow background of p tag.\nFloat right is used on both division here. First aside is floated right, and then section div is also floated right. After both floating elements, a blank div clear is used to stop next element wraping around floating divs.\nCSS Clear property is used to stop next element to wrap around the adjacent floating elements. Clear can have clear left, clear right or clear both values.\nWithout clear:both, the paragraph after floating divs will wrap around. And the next division will also wrap around, but after paragraph.\nClear: both after floating elements stop next element wrapping around.\nCSS Clear Both property does not allow any element to wrap around any adjacent Floating element. Clear Left can stop wrapping around left floating element, Clear right can stop wrapping around right floating element. But Clear Both can stop wrapping around both left and right floating elements. It is compulsory to use clear both after floating elements.\nDiv tag is the preferred element to use clear both as div is block level.\nNever use clear both on inline and inline-block elements.

{"text": "World Muslims and non-Muslims must celebrate 12th Rabi\u2019ul Awwal, 1433 \u2013 5th February, 2012 \u2013 as World Day of Qur\u2019an for Universal Male-Female Literacy.\nAnd they must do the same thing consistently every year thereafter \u2013 on every 12th Rabiul Awwal.\nAnd there is a simple and yet a most powerful and convincing reason for doing so: Because it was the Qur\u2019an that first called for universal male-female literacy.\nThe Qur\u2019an did so 1400 years ago \u2013 by asking everyone everywhere, male as well as female, to read.\nThat is one of the greatest miracles of the Qur\u2019an \u2013 and the very first one, if you look at it that way.\nAnd the Qur\u2019an has been keeping up that drumbeat, that perpetual universal call for male as well as female literacy, nonstop ever since \u2013 for all these 1400 years.\nThere is no doubt that the world has made great progress in that regard since then \u2013 absolutely, not a doubt about that. May God bless his world!\nBut at the same time, it is also true that much progress remains to be made; especially where Muslims are concerned; and especially where women are concerned; both Muslim and non-Muslim; and much more so in the case of Muslim females.\nThe real tragedy of Muslim Afghanistan is not that the Soviets and the Americans invaded and occupied it in quick succession, and laid it waste, and savaged and butchered its people, all of which are heartbreaking tragedies of course.\nThe real tragedy of Muslim Afghanistan is that the bulk of the Muslim population of Afghanistan, male as well as female, remained mired in illiteracy, for decades, if not centuries \u2013 and no one did anything about it.\nNot a squeak or whimper escaped the mouth of anyone anywhere \u2013 Muslim or non-Muslim.\nWhat everyone seems to forget is that universal male-female education is our game: It is a Muslim game.\nWe invented it; and yet we are lagging behind. Other teams are beating us, on home court \u2013 in our own game.\nSo it stands to reason that we must now go full-court press and redouble our efforts in the field of education and literacy \u2013 for men as well as women.\nAnd we must do so in all parts of the world.\nAnd if you consider it seriously, there is no better day for the world Muslims, and non-Muslims, to launch a whole new campaign for universal male-female education and literacy than coming 12th Rabi\u2019ul Awwal, 1433 Hijri \u2013 5th February, 2012.\nThat is the day associated with the noble birth of Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam.\nIt is the day that Muslims around the world honor, revere and celebrate in different ways as Maulid-un-Nabiy: Birthday of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam.\nAnd it is Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam, to whom God Almighty gave the Qur\u2019an.\nAnd it is the noble Qur\u2019an in which the very first commandment to both men and women from God Almighty \u2013 the very first revelation to Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam \u2013 was: Read!\nAnd Muslims being, maybe, over one-fifth of the population of the world, it makes perfect sense for the United Nations, Organization of Islamic Conference/ Countries/ Cooperation (OIC)/ Whatever, Organization of African Unity (OAU), UNESCO, United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) and other world bodies and organizations to adopt and declare 12th Rabi\u2019ul Awwal, 1433 \u2013 5th February, 2012 \u2013 as World Day of Qur\u2019an for Universal Male-Female Literacy.\nAnd do so every year thereafter \u2013 every 12th of Rabi\u2019ul Awwal.\nAs for Muslim governments and societies throughout the world, from Morocco to Malaysia, and everyone in between, what prevents them from declaring 12th Rabi\u2019ul Awwal, 1433 \u2013 5th February, 2012 \u2013as World Day of Qur\u2019an for Universal Male-Female Literacy?\nAnd repeat the same thing every year after that \u2013 every 12th of Rabi\u2019ul Awwal?\nCan you imagine what a glorious celebration that would be? And what wonderful benefits it would bring to the whole world in terms of culture, education, progress \u2013 and universal literacy \u2013 for females as well as males?\nCome on, let us face it! Muslim individuals and governments today control trillions upon trillions of dollars of wealth.\nI don\u2019t want to go into details, but take it from me they do.\nSo, here is what I propose super-rich Muslim individuals and societies of the world do: Regardless of what else they do or don\u2019t do with their money, much of it stolen from their fellow-Muslims, it is time for them to take out a trillion or two of that money \u2013 not billion, but trillion \u2013 and devote it to take the message of the Qur\u2019an to every home and heart everywhere.\nThat way, I say to them, you get to keep the rest of your trillions \u2013 and continue to use them, as always, for your personal profligacy and for such social purposes, that you have long been using them for, as killing fellow-Muslims; destroying Muslim societies; and perpetuating all forms of tyranny over the minds and bodies of the world.\nThat is so far as this world is concerned.\nAs for the Day of Judgment, in the next world, there I suspect you are on your own. Your God there may, and the expectation is that he will, ask you to render a complete account of every penny you ever possessed: How and from where you got it; and how and in doing what you spent it.\nThat is why I am hereby asking the super-rich individuals and societies among Muslims to repent, while there is still time, and to turn to God, and to return the wealth they stole from God and his people to God and his people.\nAnd they can all start doing this by celebrating 12th Rabi\u2019ul Awwal, 1433 \u2013 5th February, 2012 \u2013 as World Day of Qur\u2019an for Universal Male-Female Literacy, and doing it every year thereafter.\nTo the Muslims of the world \u2013 and to non-Muslims as well \u2013 I have one simple thing to say: It is time to make the goal of Universal Male-Female Literacy a done deal.\nNo more ifs and no more buts. Let us just go ahead and get the job done: starting with our first celebration of the World Day of Qur\u2019an this coming 12th Rabi\u2019ual Awwal, 1433 \u2013 5th February, 2012 \u2013 and every year thereafter.\n[PRESS RELEASE] Dr. Pasha Calls for World Day of Qur\u2019an for Universal Male-Female Literacy!", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T22:33:40Z", "url": "http://www.islamicsolutions.com/dr-pasha-calls-for-world-day-of-quran-for-universal-male-female-literacy/", "byte_size": 6202, "char_size": 6094}

{"text": "The Universal company manufactured some of the highest quality chronograph wristwatches that have ever come from Switzerland, yet today, even at a time when the vintage watch market seems to be rising almost by the month, they can still be acquired with a little effort and careful vetting for the very modest outlay of just a few thousand pounds.\nThe sheer value for money offered by this 1939 Unicompax model in stainless steel is unbeatable and we have often commented in our business that if the general public, or even the collecting community, ever wakes up and realises how exceptional these models really are, they will treble or quadruple in worth within the space of a few months. Compared side by side and judged with an impartial eye, these classic Universals are in every way equal to Rolex hand wound chronographs from the same period, yet tidy examples by the more famous brand change hands for five and even six figure sums. A persuasive argument could be put forward that in fact, the Universal was a better watch than its Rolex equivalent, not least because it contained an in-house \u201cmanufacture\u201d movement. Universal designed, built and finished its own movements whereas Rolex always purchased its chronograph mechanisms from third parties, most notably Valjoux.\nThis particular example is in nearly mint condition throughout and is of a standard that could be acquired for investment. We specialise in immaculate watches that have been clearly well cared for and these make up the core of our business, but even so, we were delighted to secure this piece for our stock. It was bought privately and we don\u2019t know its past, but it is immediately apparent from its remarkable state of preservation that it has seen very little use and almost certainly been a prized item that its previous owner, or owners, has brought out only on special occasions.\nThe large stainless steel case is almost unmarked, with only the very tiniest of imperfections here and there that must be expected on any watch that is not brand new. There have been no repairs to this case and it is among the best that has survived anywhere.\nInternally, the snap on case back is covered with an engine turned pattern and signed \u201cFond Acier ( the French term for stainless steel), Metal Chrome, Universal U.W ( Universal Watch), Geneve\u201d. Interestingly, the reference to metal chrome relates to the high chromium content used in the better grades of stainless steel alloy that were employed by the Swiss luxury watch industry in the 1930s and 1940s. The most common of these, used by everyone from Rolex through to Patek-Philippe, was Staybrite, but there were many others, among which this was one. Steel cases from this period have a very distinctive \u201cglow\u201d that is quite different from current steel models. Anyone looking at this piece, even without any specific knowledge, would immediately pick up on its old fashioned, vintage appearance and the strange shine of its steel case only accentuates this effect.\nExternally, the case back is stamped with the model reference 32401 and the unique serial number 749815. Unusually, Universal followed the system we normally associate with Rolex, with a serial number on its cases being used to identify age. Omega, Jaeger LeCoultre, Longines, IWC and Zenith are all dated by the numbers on their movements rather than cases. The two extremes for vintage Universal production for 1939 were 733333 and 766666, confirming that this piece was manufactured in the middle of that year. It is fascinating to speculate on who would have purchased such an expensive luxury watch at a time when Europe was facing great financial uncertainty as the storm clouds of approaching war grew ever darker. We do not know the history of this item, but we can be sure that its first owner was clearly a well heeled individual who perhaps regarded it as a safe, and portable, investment during a period when there was a great danger of currency devaluation and a more remote one of occupation.\nBoth pushers and the winding crown are original. These points are important when buying a vintage watch at this level. To be fair, most chronographs with rectangular pushers tend to have their originals still in place due to the difficulty of finding replacements that will exactly fit the holes in the case side, but it is quite another story with those models that feature screw in, round section pushers. Often swapped to enhance the appearance of a worn watch, screw in pushers seem to be changed routinely in the on-line auction world, which is a great shame as old stock originals for brands like Universal, Heuer and Breitling can be almost impossible to source. Similarly, keep an eye out for winding crown authenticity. We have seen a number of Unicompax and Tricompax models from the 1930s fitted with crowns signed with the Universal \u201cU\u201d emblem on their outer surface. This is not correct and Universal only signed crowns in this manner from the 1970s onwards. The appropriate crown for a late 1930s Unicompax is the polished unsigned unit here.\nWhen vintage watches are assessed by experienced collectors, more attention is given to their dials than to any other aspect. Dials are vulnerable to damage by bright sunlight, damp and any dust that manages to creep around the outside of the glass, with the consequence that most examples from the 1930s are now showing very noticeable signs of deterioration. No other component is likely to show such a range of deviation in condition and it is not therefore illogical that dial state, coupled with layout and degree of originality, has a greater bearing on commercial worth than all other factors. Cases can be repaired and non-working movements pulled back from the brink with expensive specialist work, but once a dial has become scruffy and stained, it can never again be regarded as both original and near mint. Hence those relatively few watches that exist with near perfect untouched dials command high prices when sold in the physical sales held by the major auction houses.\nThe dial on this watch is absolutely superb. It is guaranteed to be original and unrestored, yet its condition is as close to perfect as could ever be found. Scrutinised from a distance of a few millimetres with the aid of a jeweller\u2019s eyeglass, there is the very slightest ageing to the registers, but to dwell on this point would be to take criticism to a ludicrous extent. To all intents and purposes, this dial is as-new. Its silver white surface is not dirtied or foxed and the printing, in red, blue and black, has not faded with the passing of more than sixty years.\nA dial in this virgin state will command a premium and it represents a significant percentage of the asking price for this watch. The consensus of opinion is that approximately 40% of the commercial value of the best vintage watches lies in their dials and it is very noticeable that the pieces which attract the most attention in the traditional physical auction sales held by Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Bonhams are those with dials that are unmolested and still in first rate order.\n\u201cUniversal, Geneve\u201d is stated in black above the dial centre point. Prior to 1937, the simpler signature \u201cUniversal\u201d was used. Following on from the official change in the company\u2019s trading style from Universal Watch Co Limited to Universal Geneve in 1937, the double barrelled wording see here appeared on the firm\u2019s chronograph dials.\nAll five hands are original and in superb condition. Their blued steel finish is not at all corroded and is consistent with the excellent state of the rest of the piece. Finding the correct replacement hands for the lower production volume brands like Universal and IWC is very difficult and invariably turns out to be extremely pricey. In our early days in the business, we were occasionally tempted to buy watches that we knew had minor aspects that were incorrect, typically hands or winding crowns, and try to restore them back to factory standard specification. Such watches were often offered to us at what appeared at the time to be bargain prices, but in many instances, proved tremendously expensive to put back into first rate condition. We learnt our lesson many years ago and now only buy those pieces that are complete and correct in every detail. We always advise our customers that it is by far the best route to pay a little over the odds in the first instance and acquire something that is authentic and as it should be rather than cut corners and try to rectify a second rate vintage watch with components that may or may not ever be sourced in the future.\nTo return to the theme of the opening paragraph of this description, it is quite incredible that a vintage chronograph movement of this quality, which is literally second to none, can be purchased for such a small amount of money. Universal chronographs from this period undoubtedly contain some of the most exquisite mechanisms ever created, yet this example and others like it, can be bought for less than the asking price of many mass produced time-only watches offered new in the high street.\nThe movement in this watch is calibre 386, a hand wound chronograph with seventeen jewels that was built along classical lines, with an 18000 half beats per hour running speed and its start, stop and reset features controlled by means of a column wheel. While we deliberately avoid being overly technical on our website for fear of boring the casual observer, this is an important aspect that is worth some further explanation. In order that damage does not occur, it is clearly vital that these chronograph functions operate in sequence. In other words, for example, it is imperative that no attempt can ever be made to reset a running chronograph without first arresting its movement with the stop function. While beautifully made, the vintage chronographs by the elite houses like Universal are delicate and the forces involved when stopping and restarting are enough to wreak havoc with the chain of toothed gears and levers if not synchronized perfectly.\nThe crown wheel, equally correctly referred to as a column wheel, is the purist\u2019s method of chronograph guidance. In order to work, the relevant operating lever has to drop into its dedicated slot machined into the top of the column wheel. If this action is not performed, the respective start, stop or reset function cannot take place.\nWhile extremely elegant and very attractive to look at, crown wheel movements required a great deal of highly skilled hand finishing to ensure a perfect fit between this component and the levers that fitted into it and were expensive to manufacture, hence they were only offered by brands at the top of the price scale when new. The alternative system was lever actuation, which achieved the same results by means of a pivoting cam. Far cheaper to produce, the cam arrangement was widely adopted by makers who were more cost conscious and happy to depart from what had been the classical method of chronograph control since the Victorian pocket watch era.\nThe fact of the matter is that lever actuated cams worked just as well as crown wheels, but they lacked the charm and took away the opportunities to display superlative craftsmanship that were offered by the latter. The most prestigious makers, for which the eventual retail price of their watches was not a major concern, like Patek-Philippe, Rolex and indeed Universal, continued to create crown wheel chronographs while other, less eminent brands, would typically market chronographs that employed cam guidance. For the modern day collector wanting to own something truly outstanding, a classic 1930s or \u201840s crown wheel chronograph is an essential purchase and will be a source of great satisfaction.\nCalibre 386 will always be associated in the minds of enthusiasts with the Unicompax. Launched in 1936 it was effectively the junior version of the company\u2019s Compax that had made its debut a year earlier. Almost identical in appearance and of the same remarkable quality, the Compax differed slightly from the Unicompax on account of it having an additional 12 hour chronograph counter and a 30 minute register, as opposed to the single 45 minute register on the latter. Both variants are highly desirable, though it could be argued that the slightly simpler dial layout of the Unicompax has a certain extra period charm.\nMovements like this one were hand built and designed with the intention that they would be possessions for life. Their quality was so high that this objective was easily achieved provided that they were maintained correctly and sent for cleaning and re-lubrication every three or four years. The complexity of mechanical chronographs means that it is imperative that they are serviced periodically and if such work is not performed, they will suffer rapid premature wear. We regularly reject early chronographs offered to us on the basis that their neglected movements are well on the way to life expiry and it is so important to only buy an example like the piece here with a movement that is showing no signs of mechanical wear. Finished in distinctive frosted gilt, its appearance reminding us of a pre-War IWC unit, this movement gleams brightly and is not at all corroded or even tarnished.\nJust as important as condition, though the two factors are inextricably linked, is movement originality. Again, as movements become worn, there is an unfortunately tendency for unscrupulous dealers to repair them at low cost with non-standard components, often from related, but not the correct, calibres. This movement is guaranteed to be entirely standard and is today exactly as it was in 1939 when new.\nAs called for, \u201cUniversal Geneve\u201d is signed on the Y shaped bridge, with the calibre number 386 on the base plate. Operation is very smooth, with the start, stop and re-set functions performing with a definite crisp click. Everything here works perfectly and the watch runs without issue, both as a chronograph and as a standard timekeeper.\nWe have fitted this watch with a high quality crocodile skin type strap that perfectly suits its upmarket old world appearance. This is not a genuine Universal strap, but is very similar to those shown with the Compax and Unicompax models in Universal\u2019s advertising from the 1930s and early \u201840s. The strap is brand new and has never been worn.\nA lovely touch is the presence of the original box that this watch was supplied in back in 1939. Kendal & Dent was one of the most important retailers of fine horology during the inter-War period. An official agent for Rolex, Omega, IWC and Universal, this business offered high precision watches to both the public and the military. In itself, this box is a very collectible item. More information about Kendal & Dent, and in particular its proprietors F.E Coad and B.L Langman, can be found on page 180 of Tony Mercer\u2019s book \u201cChronometer Makers of the World\u201d.\nThe book \u201cChronograph Wristwatches-To Stop Time\u201d by Gerd R Lang includes quite a lot of information about Universal and its important role in the development of the luxury wristwatch chronograph as we know it today. There is an excellent large colour photograph of a Unicompax on page 135, with the watch shown from 1945, six years later than the piece for sale here. A close up of the classic Universal calibre 386 chronograph movement appears in the same book on page 236.\nThere is an excellent article in the April 2003 edition of \u201cWatchTime\u201d magazine by Gisbert Brunner, a highly respected horological historian and vintage watch collector, entitled \u201cThe 12 most beautiful chronograph movements of all time\u201d. Mr Brunner picks the dozen chronograph mechanisms that he feels are the finest ever made and includes an identical Universal chronograph calibre to the one inside this watch, the 287. Looking at the large colour photograph of the 287 in WatchTime ( page 110) and comparing it to the calibre 386 here, it is almost impossible to see any differences between the two and it seems fair to say that the latter is a very subtly refined version of the former.\nThe price of this watch is \u00a31685 GB pounds. The value for money that it represents is nothing short of astonishing and we cannot recommend it too strongly. It is a beautiful looking period piece that has been manufactured to a quality standard that has hardly ever been equalled. The only reason that vintage Universal chronographs from this era are so woefully undervalued is that the present Universal company has a very low profile and its classic work remains almost unknown to all but the most diehard aficionados. There is nothing about this watch that is inferior to its equivalent by Rolex, Omega or Patek-Philippe, yet the asking price for it here would only just cover the cost of a tidy 1950s steel Rolex Oyster in its most basic format. This is sheer horological excellence that can be acquired on a limited budget and it stands out as one of the very few models that have changed respective positions in the market place. When they were new, chronographs by Universal were among the most prestigious and most costly available and were found at Asprey, Cartier and Hermes. In fact, we have several Hermes adverts from the 1930s devoted entirely to Universal chronographs in our archives and we have used one as the background for one of the photographs accompanying this listing. The text makes great play of the fact that these can be purchased in the Hermes stores in Monaco, Biarritz, St. Tropez and Cannes, giving us a pretty good idea of the target audience for timepieces at this level. Rather anomalously in today\u2019s market, Universal has been forgotten which means, for the moment at least, before somebody resurrects this dormant glorious brand and raises its profile, exceptional early Universal chronographs like the one here are nothing short of bargains.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T05:50:39Z", "url": "http://www.vintage-watches-collection.com/watch/universal/universal-unicompax-steel-boxed-1939/", "byte_size": 17961, "char_size": 17890}

{"text": "France is in a difficult position. It has not had a sufficient spur to reform, despite the platitudes by both Sarkozy and Hollande. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a great spur to Germany, though it took it a few years to realize it. A capital strike against the periphery by both creditors in the Eurozone and international investors forced the periphery to adopt policies they would not have otherwise.\nLarge pools of capital, including central banks and sovereign wealth funds continue to buy French bonds, keeping yields near German levels. The logic is not so much about fair value based on economic fundamentals. Instead, it is a political judgment. Despite the divergence between German and French economic prowess, the two remain the twin pillars of Europe. As long as one is confident that EMU remains intact, then France's credit is as good as German credit.\nThat same logic, of course, can be applied to other euro area countries. On one hand, officials want investors to distinguish between different credit conditions. On the other hand, they insist they will not allow EMU to fail. As we have learned over the last couple of years, this does not preclude sovereign debt restructuring (Greece and Cyprus), and even capital controls (Cyprus).\nThe peripheral premium over Germany was narrower prior to the crisis. There was even a brief shining moment that Spain traded through Germany (this is to say that yields slipped marginally below German yields). Continued easing of ECB monetary policy can see spreads compress further. However, it is unreasonable to think the spreads can return to status quo ante, as the risk of debt restructuring must be perceived as higher than before.\nManagers of large pools of capital recognize there are not sufficient bunds available. Recall that next year, the German coalition government has committed itself to a balanced budget. That means new supply is not going to be forthcoming. French bonds are seen as the next best alternative, and they offer a slightly higher yield to boot. Simply, if crudely put, French bonds are to German bunds, what Agency debt is to US Treasuries.\nWithout the push of necessity, French politicians find it difficult to do the right thing. They are reluctant to declare a break from the German ordo-liberalism's drive for fiscal austerity, but refuse to embrace it. Last month, Hollande unilaterally declared no more effort to reach the EC budget targets that had already been postponed. The EC implicitly threatened to reject it, but reports suggesting that Merkel was reluctant to push France hard, possibly fearing to do to the AfD, what Cameron has done for the UKIP.\nInstead, the EC accepted some cockamamie sleight of hand. France would cut its structural deficit by 0.5% instead of 0.2% as Hollande initially proposed. This would be accomplished by 1) assuming lower debt servicing costs, 2) reducing its EU budget contribution, 3) proposing nearly a billion euro savings from a crackdown on tax evasion. Recall that Brussels had expected, and France had previously agreed to a 0.8% reduction in its structural deficit.\nPerhaps Merkel was worried about the rise of the National Front in France. Le Pen embraces the social welfare state of France. It sees the biggest threat to it, not coming from the discipline being imposed by what Thomas Friedman has called the \"golden straightjacket\", but by the encroachment of French sovereignty. The culprit is the German fist inside the EC glove and enshrined in the monetary union.\nYet the leaders of France's main political parties are doing more to boost the National Front than anyone, including, arguably, Marine Le Pen. She often claims that there is significant collusion between the major parties. She says that the Socialists and the UMP are a single self-interested group. The developments in France this week provide her with the proverbial smoking gun.\nConsider this: Hollande's chief of staff Jouyet is a personal friend of the French President. He also served in the Sarkozy government. He reportedly had lunch with Sarkozy's rival in the UMP, Fillon, who was also a prime minister in Sarkozy's government. Among the things they talked about was the investigation into overspending by the Sarkozy re-election campaign in 2012.\nWhat are not agreed upon are the reports that suggest Fillon, threatened by Sarkozy's attempt at a political comeback, wanted the Hollande government to expedite the investigation. The idea was hit Sarkozy quickly and hard to derail his hope to be elected as the head of the UMP next month. Yet, it does seem Sarkozy himself is struggling without any help. Ever since he threw his hat in the ring, his support in the polls has deteriorated. Last month, his candidate to head the Senate lost, suggesting Sarkozy's support in the UMP is not insurmountable.\nHollande's has the lowest support of any French president since the end of WWII. He is half-way through his five-year mandate, and he recently indicated he would not seek re-election if there were no improvement in the unemployment rate. It is an idle threat. Barring a miracle, he cannot win, and the Socialist Party may dump him. We might be witnessing the slow and painful death of the Fifth Republic. The other republics ended by war or a coup, but this one may be ending due to self-immolation. The Socialist candidate who ran against Sarkozy in 2007, S. Royal, who was once Hollande's life partner, used to talk about a Sixth Republic.\nAlthough Merkel is recognized as the outstanding leader in Europe, she is playing with a strong hand, the hand that holds the purse. France has a weak hand, and yet despite the lack of strong leadership, it has done remarkably well in pursuing its agenda. It has been given more time to reach the 3% deficit/GDP mandate. After years of complaining about the strong euro, in word and deed the ECB is now driving the euro lower.\nFrance has wanted the ECB to pursue aggressive monetary policy, which it now is. The ECB will likely increases the range of assets it is buying under its version of QE and if may include corporate bonds. Given that the French capital markets are more developments than most in the euro area, including Germany, its corporate bond market is among the largest. Almost 45% of the corporate bonds issued by Eurozone companies are accounted for by French businesses.\nAfter Russia occupied two areas in Georgia after the 2008 conflict, and its continuous in attempts to intimidate it neighbors, France thought it reasonable to sell Russia two ships that can be used for amphibious assaults. France has been reluctant to renege on its contract, which reportedly has penalty clauses for failure to deliver. However, within weeks of the expected delivery of the first ship, there is talk of an alternative. Reports suggest that NATO could be favorable disposed to buy the ships from France. Perhaps the logic is that it is better to own them then possibly fight against them.\nAsset managers are unlikely to declare a capital strike against France. The premium France pays over Germany for 10-year money is about 36 bp presently. In the past six months, the premium has approached 30 basis point a few times, but never penetrated. The mid-September low of 31 bp was the smallest French premium in three years. This seems to be the floor.\nThe ceiling seems to be about 47 bp, which it neared three times in the past six months, most recently on October 20. Recall that, in the four years before the crisis, there were several occasions where the French yield dipped slightly below the German yield. In any event, pre-crisis, France did not pay more than a 10 bp premium.\nNeither international capital, represented by asset managers nor the EC is going to force France to enact structural reforms. In addition, there is even less of a chance that Hollande makes a clean break and announces an aggressively pro-growth fiscal initiative. This means the continuation of the charade, yet the status quo is toxic. The political elite are committing a French version of hara-kiri. What fertile terrain for the National Front.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T06:11:45Z", "url": "http://ww.w.economywatch.com/features/French-President-Hollandes-Economic-Plan-in-Jeopardy.11-13-14.html", "byte_size": 8102, "char_size": 8102}

{"text": "Melatonin is the naturally producing hormone, which is taken in the pill form and as over-the-counter drug to aid sleep. This is very helpful in the circadian rhythm disorders, however it is often taken to ease difficulty falling and staying asleep. Suppose you\u2019re interested in using the melatonin supplement to help you sleep, you might wonder how you can safely use melatonin as the sleep aid for treating insomnia and appropriate timing and dose. Discover how you can avoid the side effects or reduce likelihood of the overdose.\nWhat Melatonin Dose to Take?\nMelatonin is actually believed to be very safe, and therefore it is available as over-the-counter in many pharmacies & health supplement stores. This can be compounded in many ways, and sometimes it is added to many other supplements meant to aid in sleep. The pure melatonin drug is often sold as the capsule or pill, but you may buy this in the liquid or spray form.\nAdvertised melatonin dose strength will range from 1 mg to 10 mg and more. It\u2019s important to know that using melatonin as a sleep aid isn\u2019t regulated by Food & Drug Administration. As such, the production & quality standards aren\u2019t enforced, thus the dose will actually differ from listed strength. So, it is suggested that it is bought from the reputable source.\nDoes melatonin help you sleep better? The research suggests that low doses of the melatonin drug can be very effective, particularly in the circadian rhythm disorders. Thus, it is tough to determine optimal dose for a person. Given such limitations, probably it is good if you take lowest possible dose. (It will mean taking 1 mg or 2 mg daily day for sleep aid.) The higher doses can be used for treating the sleep behaviors that happen as a part of the REM sleep disorder.\nTiming of this dose is important and the high blood levels in wrong times can be the problem. Thus, if you take a lot of this dose, you might actually flood the system and benefits can get counteracted. There\u2019re not any reports of the fatal overdose on the melatonin supplement alone. Although it can cause some morning hangover effects in case optimal dose gets exceeded, since it wears off, the symptoms must relent.\nRole of melatonin supplement in regulating the biological clock, and circadian rhythm, seems to be very important. Thus, timing of when to take is very important. It is generally produced in one part of brain called pineal gland and gets released during period of the darkness from night to morning.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T15:21:51Z", "url": "https://www.corelifeblog.com/how-and-when-to-take-melatonin-your-best-sleep-aid-for-treating-insomnia/", "byte_size": 2498, "char_size": 2488}

{"text": "The words alcohol and America don\u2019t sit comfortably together in my mind. Understandably, since my father fell hard to alcoholism while living his last years in a kooky town on the Californian coast, which had only one way in, and one way out\u2026 He was also addicted to prescription drugs, which he bought by the ton-load over the Internet.\nBut there is another connection between the US and alcohol in my psyche: an American gave me my first alcoholic drink. I was four years old. She was a neighbour, and had a birthday party for her daughter; having recently moved from the States, she got her Apple Juice and Apple Cider mixed up. When my mum came to pick me up some hours later, I was lying beneath the living room table: I staggered home along the pavement, my fairy wings bent.\nThese are two defining moments: I won\u2019t go back to California after the hellish week my brother and I spent trying to get my father into a rehabilitation centre, after the nightmare of negotiating his medical bills after the fourth or fifth overdose; and one could argue that the said American introducing me to alcohol gave me a taste, which I abused somewhat through my adolescence and 20s\u2026 But these are both other stories. Though the two events popped up in my mind last night after a conversation I had at a dinner party at the weekend. It was about the Little Angel Marionette Theatre\u2019s production of the \u2018Very Old Man with Enormous Wings\u2019. The comment was made by an American mother at my daughter\u2019s school who had taken her son to the performance, but had been shocked at what she saw were \u2018inappropriate\u2019 scenes that involved copious drinking. I should add here that the Little Angel Marionette Theatre is a puppet theatre, and is primarily a family venue, though some performances are more grown-up than others. This one welcomed a minimum age of six.\nThe moral is that the village turns into a money-making tourist trap and everyone becomes corrupted, even the priest who turns to cocktails and ends up getting jiggy with the village woman (please keep in mind that they are puppets, so you wouldn\u2019t call this explicit). I was a bit sleepy at this point and lulled by the dark auditorium, put my head back and had a little snooze. So when American mother questioned me about the scene my response was to dismiss it: \u2018Oh, it would have gone straight over my daughter\u2019s head.\u2019 But it did get me thinking, particularly as I have witnessed the destruction of alcohol first hand. On going home I read Marquez\u2019s story and saw that the production company had changed the setting from Marquez\u2019s Spain to a British seaside town, and that the boozy bit was also an addition. Who, after all, would hang out in a British seaside town without a bit of booze and brawl?\nI walked away from the dinner party thinking it was important that I acknowledge the possible insidious affects of this kind of performance on the tender mind of my young daughter, but I was also sorry that it took away from the overall magic of the story. The puppets were sublime, particularly that of the old man. What a beautiful ending when he finally stretches his wings and reaches out to the sky, and escapes the community who had judged him, used him, and kept him caged.\nThis entry was posted in Theatre and tagged advertising, alcohol, American culture, British culture, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, literature, Little Angel Marionette Theatre, Old Man with Enormous Wings, theatre, writing.

{"text": "Our animal hospital offers veterinary chiropractic care. Chiropractics is the practice of manipulating the spine to treat disease. When the bones of the spine are not aligned correctly, the joint, muscle, nerve, connective tissue, blood flow, and function of an area can be affected. Chiropractics is a system of manipulation and adjustments of the bones of the spine to deal with subluxations and the problems associated with them. The word \"adjustment\" is normally used in describing the specific and controlled thrust on the specific joint that is being manipulated. It restores the normal range of motion to the affected joint and releases the pressure on the surrounding tissues.\nChiropractic therapy is typically thought of as a method of pain relief for conditions such as degenerative joint disease and disk disease. However, all organs and body systems are controlled by nerves and any disruption of proper nerve flow may also affect function. Correction of vertebral subluxations may improve the health of some internal organs.\nChiropractic adjustment may result in immediate total relief of the pet's symptoms.

{"text": "James finished the preseason ranked tied for 14th in scoring (13.7 points per game) among league forwards.\nExhibition numbers mean little, or perhaps nothing, in the grand scheme of a season, but Bosh\u2019s statistical effort during the preseason is anything but irrelevant \u2014 or random \u2014 when taken in the correct context. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra spent the entire training camp drilling his players on the idea of a free-flowing, equal-opportunity offense. That Bosh, Mr. Random Guy, emerged from training camp as the team\u2019s leading scorer means the Heat\u2019s offense is healthy heading into the season opener against the Celtics on Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena.\nMore often than not, Bosh is open on the offensive end. The ball found him during the preseason, and Bosh\u2019s skills did the rest. He led the Heat in field-goal percentage (.551) while also leading the team in rebounds (43).\nJames is the driving force behind Spoelstra\u2019s idea of \u201cpositionless basketball,\u201d but Bosh might be the second-most important cog in the wheel. On most nights, Bosh is the quickest big man on the floor, and his consistent jump shot allows him to stretch defenses.\nConventional defensive strategy against the Heat calls for packing the paint to account for Wade and James. Entering his third season with the Heat, Bosh knows where to find the open spots on the periphery. He likes to call those opportunities random, but, when paired with James, the results are more like basketball jazz.\n\u201cHe\u2019s open,\u201d said James, who led the Heat with 41 assists in the preseason. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with a lot more pace and a lot more space for him, and giving him a lot more opportunities to go at his matchup.\nWade credits Bosh\u2019s big preseason to his work before training camp. Bosh skipped the Olympics to fully heal from the abdominal injury he sustained in the playoffs. Upon his return, he met with Wade and James and vowed to carry more of the load early in the season.\nWhen Bosh first arrived in Miami, the Heat wanted him to pack on muscle mass and bulk up for a life in the paint. Spoelstra scrapped that plan after the playoffs when the Heat used an unconventional lineup to win its second NBA championship. The Heat\u2019s coach instructed Bosh to focus on his natural skill set: speed, quickness and shooting.\nBosh averaged 18.0 points per game last season, but Wade says Bosh is capable of \u201cgoing for 20-plus a game and probably more effortlessly than\u201d himself and James.\nWhile Bosh has accepted the label of center, offensively he\u2019s more of a hybrid power forward than anything. The position of a traditional center is a dying art in the NBA, so much so that the league has removed the designation from All-Star ballots this season.\nFans will now vote for three \u201cfrontcourt players\u201d and two guards rather than two guards, two forwards and a center. Despite the change, Bosh still doesn\u2019t expect to garner any more votes for a starting spot.\n\u2022 The Heat finalized its 15-man roster on Saturday, cutting point guard Garrett Temple. Miami begins the season with 12 players from its championship team.

{"text": "At a time when the Catholic Church is reeling from allegations and hard criminal convictions of Catholic priests who used their positions of authority to sexually abuse young men in their congregations with virtual immunity, it is high time to re-examine the position taken by the Boy Scouts of America with regard to their ban of openly homosexual Boy Scout leaders.\nAmong many others, large corporations like Levi Staus and Wells Fargo Bank, withheld contributions to the Boy Scouts of America for that refusal, fortified by federal rulings, to allow openly homosexual men from acting as Boy Scout leaders.\nIt just wasn't politically correct, those revered bastions of business declared! Homosexual men shouldn't be judged badly, just because they want to lead a Boy Scout troop. What does their personal sexual preference have to do with their ethics in interacting with young men, they demanded?\nOver twenty years ago, my wife witnessed her young nephew in Wislow, Arizona arguing with his priest in a most disrespectful and intimate manner -- almost like a boy and girlfriend who had a tiff. Not long afterward, she became aware this priest bought the young man a car. She had no illusions what was going on between the two.\nIt is no secret that some homosexual men target young men for homosexual encounters. It is no secret that pedophiles target young adolescents of young age. Far too many women of this day who had children out of wedlock, or who are divorced with children, discovered to their horror that the men they married did so primarily to get access to their young children. There is no mystery why the rate of child molestation has skyrocketed in recent years, bolstered by the massive numbers of unwed women with children who marry men who have no paternal inhibitions about sexually interacting with the women's children.\nThe Catholic Church is presumably filled with priests fully aware and mindful of the guidelines of God, yet the unravelling drama we are witnessing reveals a pattern of homosexual sexual abuse by far too many priests who knew their positions of pious reverence in the community would protect them from the fire of their desires -- and they were right. In virtually every case, the Catholic Church would transfer those errant priests to another position far removed from the scene of their past crimes, only to allow those same priests to further victimize the children in their new congregations.\nIf any non-religious individual or corporation acted in the same way, they would be charged with obstruction of justice.\nThe Boy Scouts of America long ago correctly identified homosexuality as a sexual fetish, having nothing whatsoever to do with a person being born with a homosexual tendency, as so many homosexual rights groups allege. They fully understood that homosexual men are driven by their abberant sexual desires, and they chose not to allow any such men from being placed in a position of authority over the young men who make up the boy Scouts of America. I applaud them.\n\"I am going to address the issue of homosexuality and it's effects because I worked very closely with over 300 homosexual men in the late 60s and early 70s, which was just before gay rights groups began to organize into the political power base they represent today...\"", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T12:12:47Z", "url": "http://newnation.org/Archives/NNN-Guest-Column-21.html", "byte_size": 3297, "char_size": 3297}

{"text": "Part of the next Darkening stone book is set in the Mediaeval tunnels beneath Exeter. Very spooky. Very atmospheric.\nIs it important to have somewhere real in mind as you write?\nI think it helps \u2013 at least at first. For instance, I played in this abandoned quarry as a child, and it must have informed my writing about Scaderstone Pit. This old quarry was used an illegal dumping ground at one point, and it was below a playing field, but it isn't anything like as big as Scaderstone Pit.\nOnce I get going, I create a new world in my mind, so I don't want to be hampered by the limitations of the real world. The quarry pictured above does not look anything like Scaderstone Pit, which of course doesn't exist. In case you're wondering, the name Scaderstone comes from the Old English words for shadow or shade (sceadu) and stone (stan).\nI do believe it's vital to be consistent with your created world though. Personally, I just scribble maps and notes onto paper or index cards.\nThere's no sense of scale here. They're really just disgrams to help me remember where things are in relation to each other. I refer to them whenever the location is important. In the latest Darkeningstone book, there's a car chase of sorts, and it felt like cheating if the journey wouldn't be possible. I had to make sure that when I say the car veered around a corner to the left, it wouldn't end up somewhere stupid.

{"text": "Aims.Deflagration models poorly explain the observed diversity of SNIa. Current multidimensional simulations of SNIa predict a significant amount of, so far unobserved, carbon and oxygen moving at low velocities. It has been proposed that these drawbacks can be resolved if there is a sudden jump to a detonation (delayed detonation), but these kinds of models have been explored mainly in one dimension. Here we present new three-dimensional delayed detonation models in which the deflagraton-to-detonation transition (DDT) takes place in conditions like those favored by one-dimensional models.\nMethods.We have used a smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics code adapted to follow all the dynamical phases of the explosion, with algorithms devised to handle subsonic as well as supersonic combustion fronts. The starting point was a centrally ignited C\u2013O white dwarf of 1.38 . When the average density on the flame surface reached ~2-3 107 g cm-3 a detonation was launched.\nResults.The detonation wave processed more than 0.3 of carbon and oxygen, emptying the central regions of the ejecta of unburned fuel and raising its kinetic energy close to the fiducial 1051 erg expected from a healthy type Ia supernova. The final amount of 56Ni synthesized also was in the correct range. However, the mass of carbon and oxygen ejected is still too high.\nConclusions.The three-dimensional delayed detonation models explored here show an improvement over pure deflagration models, but they still fail to coincide with basic observational constraints. However, there are many aspects of the model that are still poorly known (geometry of flame ignition, mechanism of DDT, properties of detonation waves traversing a mixture of fuel and ashes). Therefore, it will be worth pursuing its exploration to see if a good SNIa model based on the three-dimensional delayed detonation scenario can be obtained.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T10:21:00Z", "url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2008/06/aa8424-07/aa8424-07.html", "byte_size": 1886, "char_size": 1884}

{"text": "Can you believe week six of school is already coming to a close? It seems like just yesterday freshman were moving in and it was syllabus week. Currently we are in the middle of mid-terms and it is a stressful time on campus. People are rushing about from class to class, studying, and working on those projects that are due in the coming weeks. But that is okay, there is only a week left in mid-term season and life on campus will be back to normal.\nAll the hours studying this semester have made me think about my three favorite places to study on campus, and I thought I would share them with you!\nGSIS Building: There is a lounge in the GSIS building with couches and tables for students to relax and study at. It is one of the newer buildings on campus and is normally pretty quit during the day (except when classes are transitioning). Perfect if you want to be left alone to study or do homework.\nEveryone I have talked to has different places they prefer to study but these are my top picks. Hope these help you find your quiet place to study, and ace your mid-terms. I wish everyone brains as they continue through mid-term season, it will be over soon!\nMy name is Marquette Davis and I studied abroad in the United Kingdom for one month in the summer of 2016. Although this program is called a study abroad in England, I say the United Kingdom because in the month that we were there, we were not just in England. We had the opportunity to explore the entire United Kingdom. Many of the locals we met told us, upon hearing our travel plans for the month, we would get to see more of England and more of the UK than they had ever seen and they had lived there their entire lives. Traveling to the big city of London and the small seaside towns of Northern England and Scotland and the historic cities Newcastle, Edinburgh, and Bath, and the scenic towns of Wales, we took part in an awesome adventure all over the United Kingdom. And the greatest part about it was that we could personalize it because we were in our own van. And the second greatest part about it was that we probably walked as many miles as we drove, which made for some incredible and unusual sightseeing.\nAside from the wonder of all the travel and the cultural experiences we got to partake in, the different foods we tried and the various people we met, it was an intellectually stimulating experience. Completing seven credit hours in one month, every day was busy with classes and homework. Classroom and lab times were never boring and the small class setting made each penny per credit worthwhile. Be warned, however, that the work load was not for the faint of heart. One of the greatest lessons I learned while in England was how to seize the day and make the most of my experiences, meanwhile completing a semester\u2019s worth of school work in four weeks. Sleep became a secondary need. I made the most of my time there and maintained a pleasing grade and still did not have any regrets about any missed opportunities. Even as we traveled, we lived and breathed what we had learned in our classes, making them all the more worthwhile and exciting.\nIn addition, we were in the United Kingdom at the time of the mass shooting in Orlando and at the time of the Brexit vote by which the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. With these events occurring, we were able to experience how a massive tragedy in the U.S. is globally affective. Walking the streets of London, we even came across a banner that read, \u201cWe Stand with Orlando.\u201d And we were able to see firsthand the reaction of the UK people to a major national event. Needless to say, with these events taking place and our presidential election upon us, the English people were eager to know our political stances on several issues, including gun laws, nationalism, and Trump/Bernie/Hilary, and they were eager to share their opinions on their own national issues. I had the pleasure, for example, escaping the rain one evening in Bath, to talk to the manager of a shoe store for a brief time who excitedly conversed with me over British and American politics.\nThis brings me to my next point. Of all the amazing history and incredible places we saw, it was the people that I will remember most and hold most dear to my heart. Granted I came across more rude people than I had ever encountered, but the good outweighed the bad. I will always remember the three locals we shared jokes with at the smallest pub in the UK; the friendly Chinese couple I listened to one of our students practice her Chinese with during high tea on the Thames River; the kind French girl who led our horseback ride along the beach in Inverary, Scotland; the professors at our host university; all our friendly waiters and waitresses; the pub owner who helped us struggle through the Welsh word \u201cLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch\u201d for extra credit; the employees of Dunollie Castle who allowed us to conduct a crime scene investigation in the middle of their work day and even participated as witnesses and interviewees; and all others who took our pictures, gave us directions, or made friendly conversation with us on the buses, trains, and planes along the way. I am particularly grateful and would like to give a shout out to the employees of United who were so helpful to me in the airport when I had issues with my flights and had to find my way home. And lastly, in the month I was in England, together in good times and in bad, I developed a relationship with my fellow students and with our professor that I will always cherish. Above all the experiences and sights, it is these people that I will hold dear when I remember my study abroad.\nFrom my study abroad experience, I gained seven credits toward my degree, friendships I will always be able to turn to with my fellow students, and a mentor that I truly respect in my professor. In addition, as a GSIS student, I achieved my first international experience that I believe has opened the door to many more international travels and potential career opportunities. I discovered the path I want to take in my degree program by taking Interviewing Techniques and Forensic Science and finding out what I really enjoyed to do. I grew as a person, figuring out my way through a foreign country and culture with a group of people that were mostly strangers to me before the study abroad, and was exposed to the diversity that exists just between two English speaking western cultures, really opening my eyes to the incredible diversity that exists globally.\nI am so grateful for the opportunity I had to study in England in the summer of 2016. I will never forget my time there and will eternally appreciate all the incredible experiences.\nI\u2019m Trupti Mahendrakar from Bangalore, India. Exploring and innovating is my passion. I joined Riddle in Fall 2015. Since then till now, I was encouraged and motivated to do what I like. Professor\u2019s here are so helpful. The entire institution makes me feel at home. My first semester here, I came up with an idea of making Graphene based composites. Later, I got to know that the University encourages and funds student researches through Ignite or Undergraduate Research Institute (URI). All I had to do was to find a Professor who can help me with my project and find a group of people who are interested. Thus, I started Alternate Composite Team (ACT).\nHere are some pictures of me and my team working. It may not look fun but remember \u201cAppearance can be deceptive.\u201d So come on over and try it yourself.\nI am officially signing off for good. It has been an awesome four years blogging for all of our readers out there but, its time to go!! I am happy to say that I have a job now, in the \u201creal world\u201d as the professors at ERAU like to call it.\nAs some of you know from my previous blogs I got my job through AFROTC, which I was involved in over the last 4 years at Riddle. It is a great program and if you are willing to give it a shot you can learn a lot about yourself while securing a future position in the Air Force. Not everyone makes it through but, boy does it feel good if you are one of the lucky ones who does!\nSummer is a great time where free time is not scarce. However if you don\u2019t plan it well it can become really boring after a couple of weeks.\nMy summer started in May right after I finished my hardest test, Themes and Humanities. An English class can be quite challenging. That day I came straight home and I fell sleep for about 12 hours until the next day. Some people go out dinner, others go out to party, others start driving back home, I just wanted to sleep. I was exhausted.\nI was busy to hanging out, going to the lake to do nothing other than lay down at the shore, and I started playing chess again at the Prescott Public Library (By the way, those elder men know how play chess, I didn\u2019t win one single game.) \u2014-The remaining 2 months is a story for another time.\nI realize that having fun and doing what you love is as important as getting good grades. I started thinking \u201cHow I could stop doing what I love to do?\u201d I came to conclusion that there has to be a balance between college and time for yourself and this year as a sophomore, I am going to find this balance.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T14:33:06Z", "url": "https://riddlenationaz.erau.edu/category/2016-2017/", "byte_size": 9287, "char_size": 9255}

The last thing you want is a superb online training course that is certainly not clear-cut and leaves a lot of concerns for the novice. Both content designers and scholars need easy-to-use, effective courses that will provide the necessary training without a complete lot of confusion.\nInclude a navigation screen at the start always, even if the learners are thought by you have participated in online learning before. The navigation screen should have simple and clear instructions so any learner can easily progress through the course. Simply by making navigation easy, learners can give attention to the course articles. Up navigation free. Make sure students can easily go back to prior screens if they should review any materials for a good greater understanding.\nPay attention to the structure of each and every screen. Steer clear of cluttering screens with too much information. The screen should be gratifying to the eye and designed to draw the learner\u2019s eye for the most important details.\nAdd a glossary. Never assume that the learners shall understand jargon, technical acronyms or terms. The glossary should be explain and comprehensive key terms in plain language.\nInclude frequent quizzes to check the learners\u2019 understanding of this article. Instead of having one huge test at the final end of a course, it is better to acquire short tests for regular intervals through the course. Regular lab tests and quizzes are a way for learners to measure their own realizing and build their self-assurance.\nProvide a good speak to person for inquiries. If the learners carry out have questions, will there be someone they can call? Ask one more man to check the program to see if this is practical. If you have access to content verifiers, they can point out virtually any content that is uncertain. Alternatively a pilot can be asked by you group of learners to go through the course. Ask them to present feedback on items they thought proved helpful, or didn\u2019t perform.\nEngage in continuous betterment. When you have published and released your course to learners even, there is nonetheless the opportunity to gather responses and make improvements to the course. You could incorporate some survey requesting scholars if there is anything they located unclear. This is an easy way for you to keep researching the learners\u2019 mindset and to point out to your self that you are designing classes for real people.

{"text": "It seems every day, even when I\u2019ve thoroughly researched a subject or a person and am in the middle of writing about it or her, a simple session of Internet research turns up new sources and resources that at the very least enrich, at the most reinterpret what I\u2019m doing. This is a blessing and a curse.\nI love the research, as I\u2019ve said elsewhere on this site. Once upon a time, when all we could use were books and original sources from archives, the research phase would have to finish at a certain point or we\u2019d never start writing. Now, despite the pitfalls of stumbling on inaccurate or misleading information about one\u2019s subject, the Internet is always there, all the time, as a resource to mine.\nI think I\u2019ve found just about everything useful for my project, and then one day I word a search slightly differently and come up with something that sheds new light on it, or fills in a blank I\u2019d just decided to work around. It\u2019s wonderful, but it can also be treacherous. This shiny new object I\u2019ve just discovered\u2014surely there\u2019s a place I can put it in my novel? Maybe. Maybe not.\nWriting is editing: There\u2019s never been a truer word said. As writers, we\u2019re constantly making judgments about what to include and what to leave out; what to say and leave unsaid. The true genius in a novel is getting that balance right. And that goes for research as well. I may delight in knowing the exact route of a trolley in 1910 New York, but I don\u2019t have to take my reader on a ride with it.\nSo why bother with that depth of research? Even without laying it in front of the reader\u2019s eyes, everything I know and understand about the place, period, and personages involved informs the story. Depth of knowledge creates a solid foundation that helps ensure characters don\u2019t take missteps into anachronism.\nI just discovered the video above. It was only uploaded a few days ago, so I couldn\u2019t have discovered it before. I\u2019m in the middle of a complete rewrite of my WIP and immersed in 1911 in New York as we speak.

Petitioners: Patriotic Union State: Colombia Petitioners representing the labor group Patriotic Union (Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica) came before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), accusing the government of Colombia of systematic political persecution and violence directed towards their organization. At the March 24 hearing, the petitioners described a continued and concentrated effort by Colombian officials to subvert the political influence of the Patriotic Union. Petitioners articulated that since 1984, forces acting under the aegis of state authority perpetrated murders, physical assaults, forced disappearances, and assassinations against some 6,500 individuals associated with the Patriotic Union. By cross-referencing data from elections beginning in 1986 and incidences of violence, Petitioners argued that the stronger representation the Patriotic Union maintained in seats of local and regional government, the more reprisals they faced. Petitioners voiced their frustration with the failure of a friendly settlement attempt, lasting from 1992 to 2004, citing the government\u2019s waffling over the number of victims as the main reason for the breakdown in negotiations. Describing the attacks on the Political Union as genocidal, petitioners implored the Commission to assign responsibility for the violations of the OAS Charter and regional human rights instruments to the Colombian government. In response, representatives of the Colombian government expressed concern over the alleged activities and emphasized the need for harmony between the Colombian government and civil society. Making clear that Colombia is undergoing a great time of change, representatives of the government attempted to assuage the Patriotic Union and the Commissions concerns by expressing Colombia\u2019s rejection of political violence. \u2018Without question acts such as these should not take place,\u2019 said Colombia\u2019s ambassador to the Commission. \u2018Our government would like to break with the past. Let\u2019s reach out.\u2019 The government emphasized that the past violence in Colombia must be recognized and that it would be the best interest of all parties if the dead friendly settlement talks were resuscitated under new conditions, including a reevaluation of the identified victims list. The Commission expressed concern over the amount of political violence taking place in Colombian, but was optimistic about prospect for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Commissioner Tracy Robinson inquired if there was a chance for friendly settlement talks to restart, while Commissioner Felipe Gonzalez requested an explication of the design and nature of the systematic persecution brought by petitioners.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T11:05:01Z", "url": "http://hrbrief.org/2014/03/targeting-of-the-patriotic-union-in-colombia/", "byte_size": 2887, "char_size": 2867}

{"text": "Rosedale Auto Service is sometimes asked by our customers in the Baltimore area \"what is a serpentine belt\"? When asked, one of the skilled auto mechanics on the Rosedale Auto Service team will tell our customers that were they to take a look at the underside of their vehicle they would either notice a single belt woven through several pulleys or a system of belts connected to pulleys in front of the vehicle's engine. When only one belt is present, that belt would a serpentine belt. The serpentine belt is distinguished from other belts in that it is one continuous belt that connects itself to multiple devices. On older model vehicles, multiple belts were employed to drive the various engine compartment devices. But after the serpentine belt was developed in 1979, the majority of, if not all, vehicle manufacturers began using serpentine belts due to their ease of use and overall efficiency. One of the primary benefits of using a serpentine belt is that in older model vehicles, components such the alternator, air and power steering pumps were all connected to belt systems and if one belt broke a vehicle's owner might not be aware of losing operation of one component. Alternatively with a serpentine belt all the pulleys of the various components are connected meaning a driver will know quickly if the serpentine belt breaks because ALL the components, to include power steering, will suffer immediately or completely shut down. If you live in the greater Baltimore area and are having a problem with your serpentine belt and want the advice of a qualified and skilled auto repair specialist please contact Rosedale Auto Service!", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T13:55:01Z", "url": "https://www.rosedaleautoservice.com/faq/belts-hoses/what-is-serpentine-belt/", "byte_size": 1646, "char_size": 1646}

{"text": "I have an issue for which I created a workaround, but now it doesn't work anymore and I don't know to how to solve it... So I hope someone has the same problem and knows a proper solution.\nIn my dashboard I have a map with locations, a small report and multiple filters which apply to both the report and the map. Many records in my data source have the same longitude and latitude, so they are blended as one spot on the map. I want to display only the spots on the map and in the report if they require a certain number of records. So far no problems. But here comes the difficulty... Each individual record in my data source contains a hyperlink and I want to show all urls that belong to the spot on the map. Preferably clickable as wel.\nThe workaround I created was to make an extra sheet/list with all my hyperlinks as a simple table. When I used the map or the report as a filter, this sheet was filtered as well. I added this sheet as an extra dashboard and linked the dashboards to each other. But now I don't want to use the map or report as a filter, but just the number of records in my dashboard. When I use a certain number of records as a filter for the map and report, my 'table list' sheet with hyperlinks is empty because it shows only individual records. So when I use for instance a filter for a minimum of 20 records per spot on the map and report, my corresponding list with individual hyperlinks is empty, because this list displays individual records.\nI attatched a sample workbook which represents my problem. In this workbook the filter for minimum number of records is applied only to the map and not to the report list.\nHope someone has the same problem and knows a good workaround!\nAre you still looking for help with this?\nIn sheet 3 I made a calc ([Calculation1]) that builds a string, adding on the current hyperlink to a growing list of the prior hyperlinks.\nOn V3 of sheet 3 I just made a simple sheet of all lat/long combos and their hyperlinks. I used the new 10.5 sheet-in-a-tooltip feature that lets you display a sheet in a tooltip. Go to your MAP sheet. Hover or click on a city. There is the sheet! At this time we can't click into a sheet-in-a-tooltip though.\nSo these are some ways to address what you are looking to do.\nI still needed an answer to my question so... thanks very much for your clear explanation and examples! I helped me a lot!\nThere's just one thing I don't understand how you did it. In Dashboard 2, how did you made the filter action that only displays the sheet when you click a city on the map?\nBut I still got the problem with filtering the minimum number of records. When I change the minimum number of records parameter in your workbook to 2 for example, both the tooltip and the hyperlinks list are empty. I hope you can help me with that part as well!\nLet me first address the question about Dashboard 2.\nI made a filter action with the Source being the Map sheet, and the Target being my new sheet. I specifically pass selected fields of Lat and Long. So in my sheet, only the rows that correspond with those values display.\nThe key thing is to check \"Exclude all values\" as shown below. That way the little report sheet clears out when you clear the selection off the Map sheet. And then I can just pass the hyperlink field (as you did on Dashboard 1) to the hyperlink action (Hyperlink 2) to get to the link.\nRegarding the filter... That is evaluating at the row level. So for every row, the value for Number of Records is always 1.\nI created a FIXED LOD to tell me how many rows are for each lat/long. See [Rows for Lat/Long]. Then I modified the [FILTER...] calc to use that instead. (I also displayed both SUM([Number of Records]) and [Rows for Lat/Long] on the map, and on my report sheet so you can see how they behave at the row level. (On the MAP sheet you are not displaying at the row level, so they get rolled up to the mark level for lat/long, and that's why you see 3 or 10, etc. But on my sheet I display at the row level (so that individual hyperlinks are accessible to the hyperlink2 action) and there you can see why number of records is 1, but the LOD value is still 3 .\nThanks for your super super super clear explanation!!! I never heard of the FIXED LOD function. This really solves my issue and also contributes to my Tableau knowlegde a lot!\nI was wondering if you also know if it is possible to show all results from Sheet3 (4) when no selection for a location on the map is made.\nSo for instance if my Minimum # records is 1, I would like so show the full list of Sheet3(4), and when I change the Minimum # records to 5, to show just the results that belong to this filter.\nEdit: I still needed to apply the new filter to all sheets, now it's working. Thank's a lot!\nI still got another question. The workbook I added to this question is just a 'simple' version from my original one. The original one I can't share because of privacy reasons.\nBut in my original workbook, I got a lot of filters. And the problem that I'm facing right now, is that the value for the \"Rows for Lat/Long\" has the value for all records in the data source, but my filters don't apply to this calculated field. I tried adding all filters to the \"Rows for Lat/Long\" calculated field, but I still don't get it working properly.\nI made another workbook with an editted data source so I can show you what I mean. In Dashboard(2), for instance, if I check just \"me\" in the filter \"person\" the Number of Records and Rows for Lat/Long don't have the same value, but I want them to.\nYou know a solution for this problem as well?\nThe [Rows for lat/long] calc is a FIXED LOD calc. When we do FIXED, in most cases it acts BEFORE any filters are invoked.\nFIXED does calcs on the full set of data coming in from the data source -- except for certain circumstances.\nIf you want LODs to be affected by the filters, usually we go to INCLUDE and EXCLUDE LODs. These get evaluated AFTER the filters are applied.\nThey can also be a little more confusing to get right.\nAfter you put a filter in context, the pill on the filter shelf changes to a grey color to let you know it is in context.\nAttached is your workbook with that filter in context.\nThanks Joe for your very clear explaination!\nI still got a lot to learn I see... Thank you!", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T00:09:12Z", "url": "https://community.tableau.com/message/730441", "byte_size": 6290, "char_size": 6290}

{"text": "Optical nanocomposites based on transparent polymers and nanosized pigment particles have usually been produced at low particle concentrations due to the undesirable optical scattering of the pigment particles. However, the contribution of the particles to many physical properties is realized at high concentrations. In this study, nanocomposites were prepared with transparent polystyrene (PS) and organophilic CeO2 nanoparticles using various compositions in which the particle content was up to 95 wt%. The particles, capped by 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS), were dispersed into PS and the transmittance of the spin-coated composite films was examined over the UV-visible region. When the particle concentration was <20 wt%, the transmittance of the films showed a first-order exponential decay as the Rayleigh scattering theory proposes. However, a positive deviation was observed from the decay function for higher particle contents. The improvement in transmittance may be a consequence of interference in the multiple scattering of light by the quasi-ordered internal microstructure that gradually develops as the particle concentration increases.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T12:44:41Z", "url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/tc/c2tc00084a/unauth", "byte_size": 1168, "char_size": 1168}

{"text": "Robotic automation had a big presence at the recent JIMTOF show in Tokyo, Japan. This FANUC M-2000iA shown here manipulating a section of an airplane fuselage is said to be the world's largest six-axis articulated robot. Payload capacity is 5,070 pounds.\n...and Makino featured automated guided vehicles (AGVs) topped with collaborative robots. The AGVs facilitate robot redeployment by safely, autonomously transporting them from one piece of equipment to another.\nEnd effectors designed specifically for use with collaborative robots are now being developed. For example, Schunk's Co-act gripper with soft, rubber exterior offers limited gripping force and has no pinch points so as not to cause injury to employees working close by.\nOkuma\u2019s Armroid technology is an extreme case of simple robot integration. At JIMTOF, it was shown integrated directly into the work area of a turning center. End effectors stored in the work area can be changed out to provide flexibility to change to new jobs.\nSimply inputting a new diameter value enables the FANUC robot tending this Mazak turning center to grip a new workpiece.\nA fourth robot capability shops may soon take for granted is easy automation of part measurement. As shown here with this Yaskawa robot, tending a CMM can alleviate a potential quality department bottleneck when many parts machined unattended overnight require inspection the next morning.\nRobotics have advanced to the point in which CNC machine shops\u2019 expectations might outnumber questions about practical applications. In fact, many successful shops are already benefiting from machine-tending robots or have researched various robot offerings with an eye toward adding them.\nGlobal robot sales bear out this notion. According to the International Federation of Robotics\u2019 2018 World Robotics Report, a record number of 381,000 robots were shipped worldwide in 2017, an increase of 30 percent compared to 2016. For 2018, that number is expected to increase by 10 percent to 421,000 robots shipped.\nThe maturation of manufacturing robots comes at an opportune time for shops both big and small. The lack of skilled labor and difficulty attracting young people to the field make automated machine tending attractive, especially for shops aiming to increase spindle utilization and run lights-out overnight while not staffed. Robots also can help attract prospective new hires interested in more than simply loading and unloading machines all shift long.\nRobots were particularly conspicuous at this past November\u2019s Japan International Machine Tool Fair (JIMTOF), which was the 29th edition of the biennial show organized by the Japan Machine Tool Builders\u2019 Association and took place at the Tokyo Big Sight convention center. Like the International Manufacturing Technology Show (IMTS) this past September in Chicago, Illinois, JIMTOF 2018 beat previous records for visitor attendance (more than 153,000 this year) and number of exhibitors (1,085). Industry interest in such trade shows certainly is not waning as manufacturers continue to visit to learn how shopfloor strategies such as automation can increase their businesses\u2019 efficiency and spur growth.\n1. Robots should be able to operate safely alongside people.\nManufacturers continue to need conventional robots with safety guarding to prevent people from entering the robots\u2019 work area, especially when applications call for high speed or payload capacity. At JIMTOF, however, there were just as many (if not more) collaborative robots or \u201ccobots\u201d on display.\nCobots use sensor technology to avoid harming people in the same work area. In some cases, sensors are integrated into the robot itself to stop its motion when it unexpectedly contacts an object or person. Other applications use sensors to slow or stop robot motion depending on a person\u2019s proximity to the work area.\nWhen cobots were new to the automation scene, the existing ISO 10218 standards for industrial robot safety requirements (published in 2011) did not adequately address their safe integration into a manufacturing facility. This prompted the automation community to develop the ISO/TS 15066 technical specification. One important aspect of this is that it provides robot integrators and manufacturing personnel guidance about conducting more sophisticated, preliminary risk assessments of both the cobot and the environment it will share with humans.\nAnother sign that cobot interest is increasing is the development of end effectors designed specifically for them. One example at the show was Schunk\u2019s Co-act gripper, which features a soft cover and lacks sharp corners and pinch points. Gripping force is also less than 140 Newtons (per ISO/TS 15066) to prevent injury.\n2. Robots should be able to be redeployed to multiple machines in a facility.\nJob and contract shops that machine a high mix of parts in low volumes can benefit from robotic loading just as high-production operations can. Moveable, self-contained loading units with robot and parts collection systems can facilitate this. Once the job is completed on one machine, the unit can be easily moved to another with a pallet jack or forklift. Leveling pads align these units with the machine. Some units work with various machine tool controls, and do not require the machine tool builder to supply a special robot interface. Instead, a programmable logic controller (PLC) is all that is needed to connect the machine and loader.\nA few machine tool builders at JIMTOF took this a step further by integrating cobots with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) that can move autonomously from machine to machine. The AGVs use sensor technology to safely guide them throughout a facility without bumping into equipment or people as they are redeployed to other equipment.\n3. Robots should be easy to integrate.\nThe example above describes how easy it can be to integrate a robot with a machine tool. However, the extent to which this is the case was demonstrated most clearly at machine tool builder booths with no robots on display at all. The message is not that robots are not important or valuable, but that integration is so easy that machine tool builders do not consider robots to be a necessary part of a booth display.\nThat said, some machine tools have built-in robotic automation so an integrator is not needed. For example, Murata showcased twin-spindle chucker lathes with integrated gantry loaders. In fact, the company now offers carbon fiber gantry loaders that are said to move 50 percent faster than standard loaders.\nIn addition, Okuma introduced an LB3000 EX CNC lathe with Armroid, an articulating robot loader mounted in the machine\u2019s work area for part loading/unloading. The robot operating system does not require teach-in during new job setups, and it can perform collision-free movement while machining on a part is being performed. The robot can store three different end effectors and change over as needed according to the application. Like the previous example, integrating the robot into the machine conserves floor space.\nThe JIMTOF show featured automation beyond robots. The most significant example was automatic data transfer among nearly 300 pieces of equipment on the show floor. Machine tools, robots, inspection devices and other equipment from 72 exhibitors were connected via FANUC\u2019s Field IIoT system to form a \u201cconnected factory\u201d of sorts on the show floor. Monitors in this display area showed the condition of machines throughout the show\u2019s eight halls.", "timestamp": "2019-04-19T06:55:51Z", "url": "https://www.productionmachining.com/blog/post/three-expectations-for-robot-automation-", "byte_size": 7542, "char_size": 7510}

{"text": "I have actually assessed plenty of different ONLINE MARKETING as well as multi-level marketing firms around all supplying different products and services to sell. However, I\u2019ve never seen anything quite as luxurious as what\u2019s being supplied right here. World Ventures from the outdoors virtually appears like some kind of desire work, offering all sorts of holidays as well as desire trips.\nBut if we were to take a look at this opportunity extra reasonably, we would see that this does not really exceed straight selling, which in turn could make it seem like we were a traveling agent of some types. WorldVentures having the ability to work on your own as well as from throughout the globe truly is a gift that should not be considered provided. Question is, whether an opportunity like WorldVentures reviews could truly make that happen?\nIn order to find out, I believe the best technique would certainly be to consider the possibility as a whole and also much more importantly learn, just how we would be getting our targeted customers and exactly how we would certainly be marketing to them. But first, let\u2019s take a look at the various sort of membership strategies and just how much they\u2019re asking from us to get started as a WorldVentures agent.\nWill Globe Ventures rip-off you? Chances are a person on the net, or possibly someone in your friends\u2019 circle has educated you regarding an \u201cimpressive income possibility\u201d where you can make lots of cash as well as take a trip the globe.\nWorldVentures is a direct-selling firm in the travel sector that uses the average person to construct their very own home-based service as well as also develop residual, autopilot revenue that maintains expanding if they end up being an Independent Rep.\nIn other words, you sign up with, end up being a participant of traveling bargains, restaurant price cuts and a couple of various other advantages, and offer other individuals the suggestion of joining under you.\nAltogether, these are diverse paid memberships which the chance revolves around. You offer these and/or hire people to make use of and market these subscriptions as well.\nThe WorldVentures, as well as perks, aren\u2019t something I haven\u2019t seen before, but it\u2019s still excellent. Primarily it\u2019s most likely to boil down to you hiring individuals, maintaining them motivated, as well as expanding an energetic team. This is not something very easy, and also the majority of people to be sincere, fall short in this sort of company.\nLike all Multi-level marketing firms, you get paid commissions for referring people right into this service.\nThis what provides this firm the benefit over routine traveling sites. I was looking to discover their newest settlement strategy overview upgrade as well as I discovered it.\nWorldVentures for the right people there is a lot of loans to be made. The trouble is the percent of these so-called people is around 2 % of our populace. That is why 98% of people stop working.\nThe greatest challenge for these 98% percentile individuals is they cannot hire for the life of it. As well as to be truthful, that is one of the most profitable means to make in MLM duration. I directly do not have any kind of problems hiring.\nI know in my situation, I was always on the edge of attempting the most recent and biggest Online Marketing. There are so much buzz and enjoyment, I recognize how hard it can be not to.\nHowever, the result always tends to be the exact same. And that is an absence of training, support, and resulting cause speak to. All Network marketing seem to desire you to do the same thing and that is to target just your close network of individuals, almost as though they just appreciate their own numbers as well as success.\nHowever seldom ever before, do they educate you the proper methods of creating traffic, getting leads, as well as making constant sales. Their entire expectation on success is to obtain large varieties of individuals to do their benefit them, regardless of whether or not they make it ultimately.\nHowever, I will certainly conclude by stating that WorldVentures absolutely does have a fantastic database of trips and also vacations to take place and also, I value exactly how they only have 2 or 3 subscription choices to pick from. At the end of the day however, I don\u2019t believe the high expenses of joining this WorldVentures network marketing validates the given benefits of the opportunity.\nI likewise do not assume you need to need to pay to join any kind of straight marketing opportunity, whether it be on your very own or somewhere outside. If you actually have a deep rate of interest for straight marketing, I\u2019m sure you can find any job around ready to give it to you totally free.\nJust downside to that might be the absence of residual payment. However, you might constantly head out there and also consider that a try prior to needing to invest hundreds of bucks on an unidentified possibility with unidentified results.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T22:13:22Z", "url": "https://www.motordevelopment.net/stick-to-your-marketing-plan/", "byte_size": 4982, "char_size": 4956}

{"text": "Kristin Wilson, MA, LPC, Vice President of Clinical Outreach at Newport Academy.\nMay is Mental Health Awareness Month, and Pulse is taking a look at the issues by speaking with experts. Kristin Wilson is the vice president of clinical outreach at Newport Academy, a rehabilitation center based in Connecticut that has been treating teens with mental health issues, trauma, eating disorders and substance abuse for 10 years. Wilson, who has been working there for nearly three years, spoke about helping teens heal and the stigma that still surrounds mental illness.\nI didn\u2019t take my first psychology class until my senior year in college. I was fascinated by the chemistry of the brain, by the development at both infancy and adolescence. And I really loved the idea of working with teenagers and empowering them to make better decisions at a time where there is so much neural plasticity happening in their brain\u2014when all those new channels and pathways are being developed.\nAt Newport Academy, we work with teenagers and young adults, ages 12-20. They come from all over the country to stay with us for 30-90 days. We see a lot of depression, a lot of anxiety, a lot of attachment relational issues. We see some eating disorders, we see substance abuse issues. On average we are dealing with underlying mental health issues probably 100 percent of the time regardless of what a child is classified as when they come in.\n20 percent of people aged 13-18 have a mental health condition, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. And about 50 percent of high school students with a mental illness drop out. Depression is one of the most common\u2014the National Institute of Mental Health reported that about 3.1 million youth aged 12 to 17 suffered from at least one major depressive episode in 2016.\nOne of the things that we see with teenagers specifically is that there is still a real stigma around having mental health problems and it can really cause people who are suffering to not seek out help. They are fearful that if they do they are going to get judged and for a teenager to be judged by peers or by others can be really difficult.\n75 to 80 percent of youth who need help in the United States don\u2019t receive mental health services.\nOur program is based on the idea that if we identify and address the underlining trauma, mental health and attachment wounds, we can create an environment where kids are able to connect authentically with themselves, with their peers and with their family. To create authentic connections with self means to know what you love, know what you believe in, know that there\u2019s a world outside of self and learn empathy.\nThen it\u2019s about being able to engage those kids with peers and with their family in that same process. The way that we do that is through clinical programming, creative programming, experimental programming. We also have a focus on academics; we want kids to feel good about themselves and in academic environments, sometimes that can be challenging. We offer very small gender specific classrooms where the kids can really excel academically.\nWe treat the child and the family\u2014they play such a huge role in sustainable healing. We want to make sure that we\u2019re treating the body and mind and spirit of both of them. It\u2019s about creating connections in an environment where conversations\u2014whether they are just general like, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d type of conversations or more specific around difficult subjects\u2014are allowed to flourish and that there\u2019s a place of unconditional love both the child and the parent experience together.\nWe are also noticing that holistic care really does prove to be a positive measure in treatment. Things like nutrition and exercise blended together with traditional clinical psychotherapy and psychopharm agents if needed, I think are really going to be the way of the future. We know that what you put in your body directly impacts neural chemistry and so some of the links between healthy foods, non-processed foods, GMO-free foods have shown in measurable research that they are productive in the body when it comes to increasing serotonin levels. Things like yoga and meditation, those have all been proven to have a big effect on lowering cortisol and increasing those happy chemicals in the brain.\nWe see kids coming in who have really incorporated a sense of self that is impacted by early childhood trauma and attachment wounds. They have this belief that they are not good enough or they are not worthy. One of the most amazing things that I\u2019ve been able to witness is when that belief gets challenged, where they are engaged in something that they love to do and they are really good at it, whether it\u2019s art, photography, music, yoga or hiking. All of sudden, that self belief of \u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d goes away.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T12:08:51Z", "url": "http://lipulse.com/2018/05/18/stepping-in-for-mental-illness-newport-academy/", "byte_size": 4854, "char_size": 4816}

{"text": "Kate made an appearance at a charity ball last night in aid of SportsAid, one of her charities. SportsAid \u201chelps the next generation of British sports stars by giving them financial support and recognition during the critical early years of their careers.\u201d I must say, Kate really seems to shine when she does any sports-related charity work (and by \u201cwork\u201d I of course mean \u201cappearances\u201d). I found one quote from someone Kate talked to very interesting, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve met Kate before during the Olympics, she\u2019s lovely and so interested and supportive of athletes [emphasis KMR].\u201d I truly believe this. I also truly believe this is one of the only things Kate really is interested in. I don\u2019t know why Kate doesn\u2019t focus more of her patron work on sports-related charities. She bullsh-ts around with addiction and bullying* when the only thing Kate has ever showed any actual interest in** is sports. You know, there are so many things she could do if she focused on sports, and helping youths and disabled people through sports. She might actually do sh-t if it involves sports, but then again this is Waity we\u2019re talking about, so maybe not.\nKate wore a laser-cut, black Temperley London cocktail dress that originally cost $1385 but was on sale for $554 before selling out (the dress is from fall/winter 2012, I think), Jimmy Choo pumps costing \u00a3450 ($775), and her red Alexander McQueen clutch we\u2019ve seen a few times. I don\u2019t mind this dress. For a ball, I would have expected her to wear a floor-length gown, but there are pictures with other people who are also wearing cocktail-length dresses so I don\u2019t think it really mattered. It\u2019s to the knee and appropriate. I actually like the dress. I don\u2019t think it photographs well, especially from far away, but I bet it would be nice in person, and I like the silhouette. I think she should have pulled her hair up, though. It really does get in her face. And she needs to stop f-cking touching it.\nSpeaking of Kate\u2019s hair, she went to the salon since the last time we saw her (the Daily Mail has a whole article about it). Her hair is darker brown, it\u2019s a few inches shorter, and her greys are gone. She also totally has extensions in. For what it\u2019s worth, I like the darker brown, the lighter color she had was too mousy. I do think it\u2019s funny that Kate\u2019s hair is so envied, because, really, anyone could have her hair.

After 28 years I\u2019ve collected knowledge of more than a few computer languages\u2014some of which turned out to be turkeys, some of which were extremely useful for a limited time, and others that I still use almost daily. Experiencing new languages and understanding how they can make developers more productive helps keep computer science alive for me. If I had stayed with the original set of languages that I learned as part of my training in college, I would not only be bored to tears, I\u2019d be unemployed. So, if nothing else, learning about TypeScript is an adventure for me.\nIf you do try TypeScript out, let me know what you think of it. Do the features that TypeScript provides today make working with a new language worthwhile? Let me know your thoughts at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.

{"text": "A recent survey by Uplogix found 70% of IT executives want automated control over fault diagnosis and recovery tools.\nThe survey, which polled 300 IT and network managers who run massive remote networks, found that more than 70% of respondents are looking for automated control over fault diagnosis and recovery tools.\n\"People really have a need for better automation of day-to-day management,\" said Bill Talbot, marketing director for Austin, Texas-based Uplogix Inc., a vendor of appliances for distributed networks.\nThe phone survey, which was conducted for Uplogix by Austin, Texas, research firm ReachForce, focused on companies with $500 million or more in annual revenue from several verticals, including financial services, utilities, retail, manufacturing and healthcare. All respondents were IT executives with network, telecom or LAN/WAN responsibilities. On average, Talbot said, respondents were from companies with more than 100 distributed offices. About 25% of respondents said they have more than 500 remote locations. The survey also found that around 85% of workers are not stationed at a company's headquarters.\nAccording to the survey, only 7% of respondents said they didn't need or wouldn't consider network automation tools. More than 60% said they needed automated tools to manage their networks for remote network access, as well as for network configuration, routine network maintenance, fault diagnosis and disaster recovery. More than 35% said they needed automation in all of those areas. The two areas where respondents cited the greatest need for an improved level of automation were remote fault diagnosis -- 72% -- and recovery -- 69%.\n\"These networks are becoming more distributed and more diverse,\" Talbot said. \"The cost of trying to support these remote locations is increasing all the time. It's become a bear of a job for IT folks always looking for tools to minimize cost and time.\"\nElsewhere, the survey found that 60% of companies have either implemented or are planning an out-of-band approach to improve management of distributed network locations.\nDennis Drogseth, vice president of Boulder, Colo.-based research firm Enterprise Management Associates, recommended companies should look to out-of-band options to avoid having the entire network fail in the event of a power outage.\n\"More businesses should investigate the benefits of out-of-band management,\" Drogseth said. \"The technology can provide better control over remote devices and reduce remote support costs for branch office networks that are becoming increasingly more complex and more demanding to support.\"", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T18:10:32Z", "url": "https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/news/1155455/Survey-Managers-crave-automated-management-tools", "byte_size": 2616, "char_size": 2616}
{"text": "It\u2019s amazing what a difference time can make in the way we perceive certain technologies. A few years ago, the idea of the cloud was terrifying to many people. What exactly did it mean to have something \u201cin the cloud\u201d? Was your personal information just floating around somewhere, ready for people to steal? Now, a lot of those hesitations have disappeared as people learned more about the cloud and its benefits. Businesses and individuals are more than willing to stick their information \u201cin the cloud,\u201d but it\u2019s really not that simple.\nSure, there are plenty of cloud providers in the market, but choosing the right one for your organization can be a tricky process. Brand name cloud providers are often seen as a reliable option for companies, but the truth is that they may not be the right option for your small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) needs.\nMigrating successfully to the cloud requires a SMB to have the right partner by its side, especially if it lacks cloud expertise or the time to develop an appropriate migration strategy. The right partner will be able to ensure that a SMB\u2019s cloud deployment meets regulatory requirements, offers future scalability and flexibility, and/or provides it with the most cost-effective option possible.\nAgain, finding a cloud provider that can do all of the above should be easy, but that\u2019s not always the case. A lot of cloud providers are focused on helping enterprises rather than SMBs. Luckily, there are some cloud providers that cater specifically to SMB customers.\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about SMB cloud migrations and how to choose the right cloud provider to meet your company\u2019s needs, be sure to register for the upcoming webinar titled \u201cHow to Know if Your Cloud Decision is Right for Your SMB.\u201d The webinar, presented by Ed Dryer, senior technology strategist at Steadfast, will take place on Tuesday, August 22, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. EDT.\nAttendees will gain a better understanding of public, hybrid and private clouds for SMBs; learn the operational and cost benefits of virtualization; hear what is driving SMBs today to make cloud investments; and understand how cloud services complement business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) services, managed security, and on-demand infrastructure.

It appears Feiglin is on his way back to the Knesset, while Tibi just sank below the threshold minimum vote.\nAn Israel Hayom poll published Friday morning shows former IDF chief of staff with 19 seats, the Likud down from 30 to 28, the Labor Party falling to its lowest point so far \u20135 seats, Yair Lapid\u2019s Yesh Atid stuck in the mud with 9 seats (down from its current 11, which is down from its previous Knesset list of 19), and, for the first time in this campaign, the Zehut (Identity) party, headed by former Likud MK Moshe Feiglin who is a regular pundit at Jewish Press Online, crossing the electoral threshold with 4 seats.\nThe numerous splits of the past few months, on the left and on the right\u2014some of which may end up merging by the official deadline set by the Central Elections Committee, have led to many parties that are swinging just above or just below the: Gesher, headed by Orly Levy-Abekasis, receives 4 seats, while Shas, Meretz, Habayit Hayehudi receive only 3.\nHere\u2019s another doozie: Both Avigdor Liberman and his nemesis Ahmad Tibi get only 3 seats and walk into the setting sun, probably not hand in hand.\nAnd like we said, Zehut, headed by Cool Hand Feiglin, which just held the first open primaries in Israel ever on Tuesday, and did it online (you gave them your ID number and cell number, they SMSed you a code, you clicked in and got to spread 6 points among the candidate/s of your choice) is also on the verge of the electoral threshold \u2013 but for the first time looking at the abyss from above, with 4 seats.\nParties that are so far from the threshold they\u2019re already in Party Heaven (doesn\u2019t that sound like the place you\u2019d want to go when the time comes) are Tzipi Livni and Eli Yishai, each of whom receives but one mandate.\nThe survey examined a scenario according to which Gantz and Lapid unite and bring in former Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi. The result: they all get 32 \u200b\u200bmandates, with the Likud pushed to second place with 30, while Labor falls into the 3.25% abyss and goes to pole paradise with a measly 3 seats (down from 24).\nImmediately after Ganz\u2019s speech, the Likud and New Right tried to associate Ganz with the left, while Resilient to Israel, Gantz\u2019s party, what a name) insisted that theirs is a centrist party. Well, the poll showed that 25% of respondents still do not know how to define him.\nAfter the pollsters removed the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d results, 52% of the rest located Gantz at the center, 19% see him as a right-winger, and 29% as left-winger.\nFinal surprise: on the issue of who is more suitable to be the next prime minister, Netanyahu leads safely with 38%, while Gantz gets only 22%.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T04:48:16Z", "url": "https://www.jewishpress.com/news/israel/religious-secular-in-israel-israel/this-just-in-feiglin-passes-threshold/2019/02/01/", "byte_size": 2759, "char_size": 2729}

{"text": "These two healthcare REITs are trading for dirt-cheap valuations despite high dividends and a solid history of growth.\nInvesting in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, is one of the best ways to enjoy high dividends and the potential for capital growth. On a valuation basis, REITs specializing in healthcare properties are trading cheaply right now, and two seem to be a particularly good bargain: HCP Inc. (NYSE:HCP) and Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW).\nThis type of real estate should be an excellent long-term investment for three main reasons: demographics, increased healthcare spending, and market opportunity.\nDemographics indicate a growing demand for healthcare properties over the coming decades. Simply put, the population is getting older -- fast. The 65-and-up population in the U.S. is expected to nearly double by 2050 as baby boomers age and live longer. Older individuals require more healthcare, therefore the number of healthcare facilities will grow to meet the demand.\nFurthermore, healthcare costs are rising at a faster rate than other expenditures, as you can see in the chart below. Given that commercial properties derive most of their value from their ability to generate rental income, healthcare properties should appreciate faster than other property types as long as this trend continues.\nFinally, the healthcare real estate market is about $1 trillion in size, and no REIT has more than a 3% market share. The industry is highly fragmented, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for new investments from existing properties, in addition to the opportunities that will come from future growth of the industry.\nHCP is one of the \"big three\" healthcare REITs, and it owns 1,179 properties in a variety of categories -- mainly senior housing, post-acute care, life science, and medical office buildings. Essentially, the business model is to acquire attractive properties and team up with some of the best operating partners in the business, such as Brookdale Senior Living.\nThe company pays a notable 7.1% dividend yield and has an even more impressive record of dividend growth. In fact, HCP has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.\nHCP's biggest recent news item is the planned spinoff of its HCR ManorCare assets, which include virtually all of the post-acute/skilled-nursing properties in the company's portfolio. You can have an in-depth look at the spinoff, but the general goal is to allow HCP to focus on its private-pay senior housing, life science, and medical office properties, thereby improving portfolio quality and giving the company more financial flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. The spun-off assets, meanwhile, will be placed in a newly created REIT that will strive to maximize their value.\nAccording to HCP, once this happens, the company can employ several new strategies with these properties, including some that are not possible or practical while the assets are still a part of HCP.\nData source: HCP company presentation.\nMedical Properties Trust focuses on hospital properties, which, according to the company, produce better initial yields than other types of healthcare real estate. In fact, the company is the fourth-largest owner of for-profit hospital beds in the country.\nData source: Medical Properties Trust.\nThe company has 204 properties located in 29 states and four foreign countries, and the long-term plan calls for even further international diversification. This way, if one market faces headwinds (say, the U.S.), it won't represent virtually all of Medical Properties' assets.\nThe company does have a relatively high debt load for a REIT: Debt represents 51.6% of Medical Properties' assets, so there's added risk to consider. However, 98% of the portfolio's leases have annual rent increases built in, and the company's payout ratio is less than two-thirds of FFO -- lower than that of most peers.\nIn short, there's no reason to believe Medical Properties Trust will have any debt-related issues going forward, with a growing stream of income that's already more than enough to cover the dividend.\nNote: Share prices and guidance are current as of 5/23/16. Normalized or adjusted FFO guidance is used when available.\nNo stock with double-digit growth potential is without risk, and these two are certainly no exception. In fact, a higher level of perceived risk is responsible for the low valuations. Healthcare spending could slow, operating partners could face greater financial difficulties, or there could be a shortage of attractive acquisition opportunities in the target property types. Any one of these factors could cause these stocks to take a dive.\nHowever, I think the growth potential and the solid track record of delivering profits in a variety of economic climates more than make up for the risks. Either of these healthcare REITs would make a solid addition to a well-diversified dividend growth portfolio.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T09:57:25Z", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/23/these-2-high-yield-dividend-stocks-are-ridiculousl.aspx", "byte_size": 4993, "char_size": 4993}

{"text": "Considering last fall\u2019s wet weather and the soggy fields this spring, farmers wonder about using inoculants on soybean seed in 2010. Should you use a rhizobium inoculant? Or, is there enough of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Bradyrhizobia japonicum, remaining in the soil?\nTrue, rhizobial bacteria don\u2019t survive wet conditions very well. But whether it will pay to use an inoculant depends largely on whether soybeans were grown in the field sometime during the last five years or if the field has been flooded for more than a week, says Aaron Saeugling, Iowa State University Extension field agronomist in southwest Iowa.\nThe presence of rhizobia in the soil is necessary for a legume such as soybeans to be able to convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form usable by the plant, he says. This process, nitrogen fixation, is critical for producing high soybean yields. For nitrogen fixation to occur, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria need to be readily available in the soil or must be applied to the seed.\nWhen soybean seed germinates, the rhizobia bacteria invade the root hairs of the seedling and begin to multiply. Nodules, the structures that house the bacteria, form on the roots. Under field conditions, nodule formation can be seen shortly after emergence, but active nodule fixation of N from the air doesn\u2019t begin until about the V2 to V3 growth stage of beans. After that point, the number of nodules formed and amount of nitrogen fixed increase with time until about midway between the R5 and R6 growth stages; then N fixation decreases sharply.\nApplying nitrogen fertilizer for soybeans isn\u2019t recommended because it typically doesn\u2019t increase bean yields in Iowa production systems. The total number of nodules that form decreases with increasing amounts of applied N.\nToday, most fields in the Midwest have had soybeans grown on them in the crop rotation, likely increasing population density of Bradyrhizobia bacteria in the soil, notes Saeugling. Improved inoculant technology, coupled with higher commodity prices, ease of application and relatively low-cost inoculant products, have many growers reconsidering the use of inoculants.\nSince 2003, ISU agronomists have conducted trials each year to assess new inoculants on the market. Overall, the ISU studies haven\u2019t shown a consistent yield response to use of soybean inoculants in fields in Iowa with a history of having soybeans grown on them.\nCurrent recommendations for Iowa are to inoculate the seed if a field has never been planted to soybeans, or if beans haven\u2019t been grown in the field for the past three to five years. Other situations where it\u2019s recommended to inoculate are if soil pH is below 6.0, or if a field has sandy soil, or if a field has been flooded for more than a week, creating anaerobic conditions.\nRising cost of production and volatile commodity prices are driving the need for soybean growers to improve profits. But the use of inoculants to increase yield may not be the answer, especially if beans have been grown in the field recently. In fact, using inoculants on soybeans without an active on-farm testing program could be costing you money. But if a field hasn\u2019t produced soybeans in the past three to five years or has never produced soybeans, an inoculant is needed for nitrogen fixation to occur.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T22:34:34Z", "url": "https://www.beefmagazine.com/tackntogs/when-inoculate-bean-seed", "byte_size": 3324, "char_size": 3306}

{"text": "Modelling movement is an important topic in fields ranging from ecology to medicine. In particular, glioma, an often fatal brain tumour is characterised by its diffuse invasion into the surrounding normal brain tissue, enabling the tumour to escape therapy. In this thesis we focus on the mathematical modelling of glioma and movement in general. We begin by exploring the basic structure of the brain, describing glioma classification and the hallmarks of cancer as well as reviewing mathematical models of glioma. In Chapter 2 an Ordinary Differential Equation model is presented to describe the interaction between healthy and mutated cells in vivo and vitro scenarios. The model is extended to a Partial Differential Equation to cover the spatial dynamics of interaction and the possibility of travelling wave solutions. A leading hypothesis suggests that malignant glioma cells switch between proliferating and migrating phenotypes, a mechanism known as the \u201cgo or grow\u201d hypothesis. Although the molecular mechanisms that control this switch are uncertain, it is generally assumed to depend on micro-environmental factors. In Chapter 3 we propose a simple mathematical model based on the go or grow hypothesis for brain tumours (gliomas). The model describes the competition between healthy glial cells and malignant cells, with the latter subdivided into invasive and proliferating subpopulations. Simulation and stability analysis is performed for spatial and non-spatial versions of the model. The model incorporates two types of switch between migration and proliferation glioma cells: a constant switch form and a density dependent form. In Chapter 4 we present a framework for modelling a different characteristic movement lengths based on a biased random walk in response to external control species. We use the model to understand different strategies by which a population may locate some resource in its environment. Further we consider a pilot application to glioma, showing how it can be used to model movement along different brain structures. Finally we conclude with a brief discussion that summarises the main results and highlights directions for future work.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T11:32:50Z", "url": "https://www.ros.hw.ac.uk/handle/10399/3169", "byte_size": 2185, "char_size": 2181}

I would like to know for backup purposes etc.\nIe if I was restoring the server from an image what would I need to restore from the backup to recover the mail.\nRe: Where is the mail stored in the filesystem?\nFound using forum search feature.\nChristian is correct. It is stored in a mysql database. Xtrabackup (Percona.com) for live incremental backups or mysqldump to backup just the email. By default mysql is setup for one big file instead of table per file.\nUse the ssh connection method with your regular user name.\npassword is stored in /var/lib/zentyal/conf/sa-mysql.passwd.\nThis gets you initial connection as sa. You can then add a user with needed privileges to do what it is you want to do. I do not recommend using the sa regularly. I assume that you are going to the mysql-dump route?\nHmm. . . this gets asked often enough that maybe it should be a sticky or in the tips and tricks section. Add on that eventually the email system will get sluggish and prone to crashing because of the \"all tables in one file\" decision and I think that a decent write up is in order. Sort of follows along with my next free time (chuckle) project which is to play with clustering Zentyal. I haven't forgotten that, christian. Just incredibly busy.\n*hint hint* volunteers please step forward..\nFirstly thanks for everybodies help on this.\nI'm running zentyal 3.0 (core 3.0.17) so what I'm about to say may not be relevant to earlier versions.\nthere are a few corrections to what folks have said on here.\nThe mail isn't actually stored in the MySql zarafa db. I loaded around 8000 mail items into the zarafa and it didn't significatnly affect the size of the database.\nThe mail and also the zarafa-search indexes (if enabled) are actually stored in the file systm under /var/lib/zarafa.\nThe configuration files would give the impression that this is just attachments but it appears to be all emails as well. Each email and attachement is stored in a nested, numbered folder structure as a gziped file.\nI wanted all my data stored on a NAS rather then on the server itself. This was quite easy to achive for the mail. It was simply a matter of copying /var/lib/zarafa to a new location and then creating a symlink from the /var/lib folder to the new location.\nRe: [SOLVED] Where is the mail stored in the filesystem?\nI am taking a closer look at users and privileges concerning mysql in the latest version. The file structure that you describe is really just the index.\ncopy the directory somewhere for safe keeping.\nOne not of caution -- I don't store attachments outside the database so I can't verify where they are.\nDid you setup file per table? If not they are stored in /var/lib/mysql/ibdata1. You will find that ibdata1 is rather large.\nBTW mysql doen't play nice over nfs. If you want real-time redundancy, you will have to setup replication (now you are getting into HA and load balancing).\nI was wondering about backing this file up. I run automysqlbackup which backs up all the databases. Will this be included somewhere? In the zarafa db backup? I wonder because it's sat outside the zarafa folder?\nIf you configured it to backup all databases then yes it will do the work. There are pluses and minuses to using mysql-dump. While every mysql install will have the tool, it still demands server downtime while backing up. Incremental, no downtime backups can be had with xtrabackup.\nThe design decision (not bug) in mysql s innodb engine causes it to become unstable over time in my experience. The database doesn't shrink as you remove data. Instead the file stays the same size and just the row information is removed. It tends to make things too big for the memory and storage footprint after some time. It also fragments the data causing queries to run slower. Normal optimization tools don't work on innodb in the single file configuration. Some will find this as an issue and some will never know.

{"text": "The Admirals lost 3-2 in overtime on the road against the San Antonio Rampage Wednesday night. Despite generating plenty of offensive chances the Admirals were forced to comeback twice in this game before losing in overtime. It is the Admirals first point gained after losing 5-1 to the Oklahoma City Barons the previous two outings yet there is a feeling that the Ads could just have easily taken the full haul tonight in San Antonio.\nAfter a very tightly defended game the scoring broke open 14:58 into the second period from yet another shorthanded goal allowed by the Admirals. Brett Olson somehow wired a long range wrist shot from the far right wing wall against the grain of Marek Mazanec and up and over his glove side to tally his eleventh goal of the season. It\u2019s the ninth shorthanded goal allowed by the Admirals this season.\nThe Admirals power-play pressure picked up following the shorthanded goal and, with Jonathan Racine fresh out of the box, the Ads answered right back. Johan Alm was able to secure a keep in on the left point and threw a low shot in on Michael Houser. The puck kicked out right to Mark Van Guilder who scored his eighth goal of the season on his milestone night as he became the Milwaukee Admirals most tenured player in the AHL era of the franchise in tonight\u2019s game.\nSan Antonio went back out in front with a goal from Dany Heatley in the third period. A great rush through the neutral zone by Jesse Blacker led to a drop off for Heatley who dropped off for the trailing Corban Knight who went forehand to backhand as he passed right back to the net front drive of Heatley. The shot attempt from the veteran sniper was fanned on but the puck went in off of his skate for his first goal since joining the Rampage.\nLess than three minutes later the Admirals were able to equalize through Austin Watson\u2019s twentieth goal of the season. Viktor Arvidsson had a slap shot attempt from the left wing faceoff dot but his stick exploded. As the puck rolled down behind the net Watson took a quick swipe on net and managed to bank a shot off of Houser and in. It is Watson\u2019s third consecutive season of scoring twenty or more goals with the Admirals.\nIt took overtime to decide this game and, sadly, the lone point was all that the Admirals managed to earn tonight. Just eighteen seconds into the overtime period and a great series in attack for the Rampage teed up Blacker for a rifled shot in tight to Mazanec from the left wing and he buried his sixth goal of the season to end this game at 3-2.\nThere were certainly far more positives than negatives on this night for the Admirals. They mustered up thirty-five shots on Houser and held the Rampage to only twenty four shots on goal. Defensively things were far better than they were as early as last night\u2019s game and it gives them something to build on for this weekend\u2019s games against the Texas Stars.\nRamblings: Tonight\u2019s scratches for the Admirals included Mike Liambas (right-leg laceration), Miikka Salomaki (upper-body), and Jonathan Diaby (healthy).\nThoughts on tonight\u2019s performance? Loss aside, was this a much improved effort by the Admirals than last night? Can you credit this as a solid game by Michael Houser that stifled the Admirals shooters?

{"text": "The ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) was established in 1972 and since then has gone to oversee the professional aspects of men's tennis. Since then it has gone on to provide an official ranking system and be responsible for a professional governing body for players to enter a range of tournaments that are currently hosted around the world.\nThe body itself included members from the MTC (Men's Tennis Council), members from other governing bodies within tennis such as the ITF (International Tennis Federation) and a host of tournament directors. From this the ATP Tour was born which includes a number of ranking events with prize moneys of $100.000 and higher.\nThe highlight of the ATP tour comes in the form of the ATP World Tour Finals played in the O2 Arena, London. The tournament is the season finale of the tour and includes the top 8 ranked players for both men's singles and doubles. Prize money for the event reaches within excess of $4million and is the richest event outside the four major tournaments.\nThe ATP World Tour Masters 1000 is a 9 event series taking place in cites around the world including California, Florida, Monte Carlo, Madrid, Rome, Toronto, Ohio, Shanghai and Paris. With prize money ranging from $2million to $3 million and world ranking points of up to 1000 for the winner, the competition provides one of the most lucrative series in the tennis calendar and is only topped by that of the ATP World Tour Finals and the four majors.\nOther ATP run tournaments include the World Tour 500 Series, World Tour 250 Series, and the Challenger Tour. Each tournament provides a larger number of competitions throughout the year, but has less prize money and ranking points the less exclusive they become.\nBet365 has quickly established itself as one of the largest bookmakers in the world. One of the biggest reasons for this is the sheer volume of sports they offer, which includes tennis. Their tennis betting section is rivalled by very few in the industry and includes all of the ATP Tour events. Markets for each match can range anywhere between 5 up to 100 for the higher profile games.\nIntertops is one of the most respected bookmakers in the world and again, provides a more than suitable home for any tennis bettor from the United States. Their market coverage is excellent including all the major ATP tour matches, but on top of that extensive coverage of all four of the tennis majors are included on the site, which can be found here.\nIntertops also happens to have one of the most lucrative welcome bonuses ranging all the way up to $200. Most importantly, you can place bets on a number of events during a match as well.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T08:28:36Z", "url": "http://www.tennisbet.net/atp-tennis-tournament-online-betting", "byte_size": 2670, "char_size": 2670}
{"text": "Queen Elizabeth II has always been a strong champion of British couture - especially in her stunning 50s fashions. Her charm, confidence and regal style captured the imagination of the American public when she hosted the President and Mrs. Eisenhower at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. Wearing a magnificent pale green crinoline evening dress - hand-embroidered with sequins, pearls, beads and diamante - she regally displayed her passion for fashion. Now, in honor of that historic occasion, The Hamilton Collection recreates her royal look with the Reflections of Queen Elizabeth II Figurine, an exclusive, limited-edition first-ever.\nEvery inch of this handcrafted figurine is skillfully crafted and painted by hand, from her regal pose and sculptured fur wrap to the intricate bas-relief floral pattern on her gown.

Great way to start back to work. Thanks for getting this twin momma out!\nLoving taking time off work to raise our girls!!\nI love my best friend @karee487 !! Always thinking of others. Love my get well gifts \ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffbso blessed.\nWe love showcasing designers in their space!\nRead up some more about this amazing kitchen I recently blogged about. Get more insider tips from Cecilia Casagrande Interiors!!\nIf you have not heard of Boston Home Magazine I suggest you run out and get a copy now!!! Also a big reason why is because we just got published in the magazine! It is my favorite local magazine as it only publishes local high-end designer homes. Even just the quality of the magazine is amazing, the thickness of pages and the color! It is chock full of wonderful photography and great articles with little to no advertisements. A real great read! You can always find articles online but I find online distracting with all the advertisements popping up. There is something special about curling up with an artsy quality magazine and a cup of tea for inspiration on a Saturday morning! I also am a big advocate for printing photographs.\nI teamed up with Cecilia Casagrande Interiors to photograph her kitchen showroom. These photos may wow you but if you could only step into her kitchen you may just fall over. I wanted to skip and dance for joy when I first met Cecilia the first time for tea in her gorgeous kitchen. And let me tell you this kitchen gets a lot of use with her young boys and her amazing cooking skills I had the benefit of enjoying during our shoots! If you haven\u2019t heard of her yet she is a rising star, she aleady was published once before in Boston Home Magazine in their Summer 2016 issue. http://www.ceciliacasagrande.com/press/ Not bad for your first year in business!!\nIf you haven't heard of Cecilia Casagrande yet, you will soon! The up and coming interior designer is amazing and I have been fortunately enough to photograph her work. She is focused and has an attention to detail I have never witnessed. Not only is she a fabulous designer but also amazing at styling which is always helpful for a photographer!\nIf you are looking for a fresh look for your home you must visit Cecilia's Brookline, MA home which showcases her amazing design. When we first met for tea to get to know each other and as I walked through her front doors I felt giddy and delighted as her home whisped me off my feet!!!\nShe is currently working on my new home. Being a creative person I usually am able to do this myself but with a busy work schedule and a fresh canvas home I thought I should call in a professional. She really helped me develop and perfect my personal style and what is truly was truly important to me. What pieces were visually inspiring and had a special story got me excited! She is amazingly creative and also amazingly organized keeping us on task and focused through the design process.\nI'll be posting some before and after photos on the blog as our design journey continues here at Natalia Foto! For now check out our amazing mood board!\nFollow Cecilia at her website or on instagram!!", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T02:18:50Z", "url": "http://www.nataliafoto.com/blog", "byte_size": 3342, "char_size": 3331}

{"text": "Maternal cigarette smoke exposure (SE) during gestation can cause lifelong adverse effects in the offspring's brain. Several factors may contribute including inflammation, oxidative stress and hypoxia, whose changes in the developing brain are unknown. Female Balb/c mice were exposed to cigarette smoke prior to mating, during gestation and lactation. Male offspring were studied at postnatal day (P) 1, P20 and 13 weeks (W13). SE dams had reduced inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and toll like receptor (TLR)4 mRNA), antioxidant (manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)), and increased mitochondrial activities (OXPHOS-I, III and V) and protein damage marker nitrotyrosine. Brain hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1\u03b1 and its upstream signalling molecule early growth response factor (EGR)1 were not changed in the SE dams. In the SE offspring, brain IL-1R, IL-6 and TLR4 mRNA were increased at W13. The translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane, and MnSOD were reduced at W13 with higher nitrotyrosine staining. HIF-1\u03b1 was also increased at W13, although EGR1 was only reduced at P1. In conclusion, maternal SE increased markers of hypoxia and oxidative stress with mitochondrial dysfunction and cell damage in both dams and offspring, and upregulated inflammatory markers in offspring, which may render SE dams and their offspring vulnerable to additional brain insults.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T22:32:39Z", "url": "https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/44011", "byte_size": 1376, "char_size": 1373}

{"text": "Here at Cornerstone Residential Builders, we are proud to be entering our 21st year of operations. We have been building in Fuquay-Varina for more than a decade as well, with almost three dozen custom homes already completed in the area. Right now, we are excited to have a custom home building project underway in the Varina Park community and another project set to break ground soon in the Fleming Fields community as well.\nOur clients in Fuquay-Varina choose us for our history of fantastic customer service, close communication throughout the custom home building process, and for our unmatched attention to detail in every aspect of our projects. We also have a reputation in our industry for honesty and fairness, doing exactly what we say we will do without ever cutting corners. As a custom home builder, we feel that these values and practices are necessary to serve our clients properly.\nAt Cornerstone Residential Builders, we have the capabilities necessary to approach a custom home building project in Fuquay-Varina in one of two ways. Firstly, we offer design/build services for clients who come to us to build the custom home of their dreams. After an initial meeting with the customer to determine their specific requirements, we establish a preliminary budget and a complete specification package containing all of the details of their custom home building project. Once this pre-construction phase is completed and contracts are signed, work begins, and their custom home is generally complete within 6 to 8 months.\nWe also specialize in building custom spec homes in new and existing neighborhoods in Fuquay-Varina and throughout the Triangle. Our decades of experience helps us assess other homes in the neighborhood and the specific lot conditions to determine the best floor plan, fixtures, and trim level to maximize success. Because we are a custom home builder, no two homes we build are exactly the same, and we always take care to add special, unique touches to truly set each home apart from all the rest.\nInterested in Custom Home Building in the Fuquay-Varina Area or Anywhere in the Triangle? Click Here to Contact Us for a Free Consultation!\nWhile a large number of local custom home builders were not able to weather the housing market downturn of 2008, we at Cornerstone Residential Builders remained strong because of our attention to detail and because we never overextend ourselves. We believe that being comparatively conservative in our operations enables us to focus more thoroughly on each individual custom home building project and will ultimately allow us to stay stable long into the future, regardless of any ups and downs in the housing market.\nNo matter what you have in mind for your custom home building project in Fuquay-Varina or anywhere in the Triangle, we at Cornerstone Residential Builders are your ideal partner to achieve the results you really want.
